I'm pump, pump, pump, pump, pump Um, from bump from from happy you fit the July everybody. It's good to see you. Come on in. Come on in. There's plenty of room. Yes. What Today? We got lots of stuff to talk about. But first, before we talk about all this stuff, there's something you need to dio Something you need to do every morning it's called The simultaneous Sip Makes everything better. Yeah, it does. And all you need is a couple of mugger glass. A tanker tells Erstein the canteen jugar flask of vessel of any kind. Fill it with your favorite liquid. I like coffee and join me now for the unparalleled pleasure, The dope being hit of the day, The thing that makes everything better, including fireworks and pandemics. Racism, You name it. It's all better with the simultaneous simp. Let us bring the country together. Go! And for my international viewers we'll bring the world together a second sip for inclusivity. Home. Very good. Very good. Can you feel the unity? I think you give a little bit because you feel in a way you feel exactly like you did a minute ago, but with slightly more unity. You feel it? I think you do. Well. Um, as you know, fireworks were banned in l laud last night because of all the dangers. But it was also the Fourth of July, sometimes called Independence Day, at least for a part of the country. And I don't think the citizens of the United States gave ah, fuck what the government said last night. I think everybody's just done with government. It feels like people said, Wait, it's independent. Stay on the government's telling us we can't do shit. How about we just do twice as much of that shit today? How about we just actually have an actual Independence day and just say fuck everything and everybody and just send off fireworks, mingle to our death and live our lives? You know, I'm I'm, uh, simultaneously thrilled and uphold by how, by how Americans acted last night through the appalled park is that obviously people acted in ways that are clearly unsafe and not recommended. Do I recommend that people act in ways that are unsafe, health wise or fire wires or otherwise? No, I do not recommend that, but when they do it, I like it better? I don't know. I can't explain those two feelings. I just just gonna have to be happy with having two conflicting feelings. It's like, No, don't do that. Well, I'm glad you did. I'm up to 500,000 followers a little bit more. Uh, you might call that half a 1,000,000. Uh, there was something if you didn't see the videos of the wide shots of all the fireworks go off in L A last night. You have that. You have to look for that video because it's just sort of I don't know where is taken from a high building or a mountain or something. And then the entire Los Angeles was just exploding. Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam! Uh, I thought I heard more fireworks last night. Locally, Just inside my house, I get hearme or explosions. It sounded like it was in the middle of a war zone, a way of half a 1,000,000 followers. As I told you, when I reached a 1,000,000 followers, I will effectively be running the world Now. The reasoning behind that is that, uh, influence has two parts. One is how much talent you have for influence but the other is how many people are paying attention? So if I can get a 1,000,000 people to pay attention to, say, a 1,000,000 followers, um, that I'm pretty dangerous halfway there. Uh, there was an article in The Guardian about magic mushrooms, psychedelic mushrooms and once again, just they're just continues to be mounting anecdotal and other evidence. The psychedelic drugs and mushrooms being one of them, help people with PTSD. Now, given the enormity of PTSD, especially last night, how many people got triggered last night? Who had military experience? Probably probably a few. And we know that the psychedelic mushrooms almost certainly I would say at this point, the odds of these being effective medically without much of a downside. It's close to 100%. You know, when we talk about hydroxide calorically and I still put the odds of that at 30% that it's gonna make a big deal, even though some of the studies say yes. So that's just you engage my level of certainty. I drive folkloric with lots of evidence, and still I just say a 30% chance that that's really something important. Um, but with the psychedelic mushrooms I think is closer to 100% because it's just so universally true. If if you gave hydroxy claure queen to 10 people and nine of them said that just made all the difference, you probably stopped studying. Yeah, if it was that, obviously that made a difference. We wouldn't even be studying hydrochloric when we just say All right, we just give it to everybody. Nine and 10 people got better the, you know, an hour after they got it. And psychedelic mushrooms air. Sort of like that, you know, one trip and people say, you know, I think solves that problem. It is so consistent. The fact that the United States keeps that illegal. So there is hard to experiment with, even in this country. So researchers can do what they need to do because of government regulations. If, um, if Kanye ran on a platform of getting rid of these were drug laws, I don't. You probably win, but the president should get rid of those. Anyway. Um, did you see the article in The New York Times suggesting that offices might need to spray bleach all over their equipment? Have you heard that? Yeah. The New York Times is reporting that that because the World Health Organization is saying that the virus stays airborne for a while, you might have toe spray bleach all over your computers and your electron ICS every day in the office. Don't know. They didn't say that. 00 they didn't say that. So it's not true. Well, I read it right in the article, it said that said from The New York Times article said that, um, they were thinking they might need a UV light in offices as a disinfected That's bleaches, that they I'm sure they told us that because I used to think UV light was just part of the light spectrum, which happened to have the quality that it kills viruses. And back in the old days, I thought, Oh, well, it's just a light. But once the president mentioned using UV light as a disinfectant, I was reeducated to find out that when the president says, UV light could be used as a disinfectant, potentially even in the lungs, because they were testing, putting it on a ventilator and just ventilating your lungs directly with light. I mean, not ventilating but disinfecting. But the mainstream media has taught me that what that really means is bleach. So even if you say UV light, what you mean is actually just bleach. So they wanted to spray bleach all over offices. I think, unless I'm confused by the article, um, so The Washington Post, The New York Times and every dead brained Democrat has decided that the phrase for the summer will be dark and divisive. So the president's speech about Rushmore was dark and divisive, dark and divisive. That's really good. It's actually better than dark. You remember they got some extra expert advice in the last election to the Democrats and after the president's campaign speech at his, uh, whatever he called the Republican convention, they all said It's a dark speech. It's dark, dark, dark. But now they've upgraded it to darken Devices. Dark and divisive is better, and dark was pretty good. So so the Democrats have cranked it up, and the I would say the quality of their campaign now is pretty good. It's pretty good. Um, so we'll talk about that in a minute. Eso it's is really shocking and amazing. If you happen to be aware of your aware of your environment, which many people are not. And you read how the press has clearly colluded. It's obvious that the press has gotten together. They all got the memo there working for the Democrats. We don't have any question about that anymore because they all came up with the same phrases at the same time. There's no doubt about it and for them to turn their speech into what they turned it into. If it's just amazing that people can read these publications and come away with away from the thinking that they're even trying to trying to produce news, the fact that anybody thinks these are news organizations aim or is mind boggling. But the way that said I had my own complaints about the president's speech because he uses words, culture and heritage in ways that I think either are intended to be divisive in the sense that they're good for the base, but not good for the general election or, uh, or he doesn't know the difference. And there's nobody on the on the team who can tell him the difference because, honestly, if I heard heritage and culture and I thought that my background were my my, uh let's say my ancestors history was mostly slavery, and then the ripple effect from slavery. I would not be looking to celebrate heritage and culture. I would feel like a that's white people, heritage and culture. So I would say that is the one complaint that, well, it's not the only complaint that they have a good point on. But is one complaint. They do have a good point, Um, and to the extent that the president continues using words like that and the Republicans do, those are losing words in a sentence. In other words, those are the words you use if you're not really trying to win honestly on. And some of us have had some question about whether the president is really in it this time. Now I've heard other people say, I think Mike Service says this, that the president's speech at Mount Rushmore was actually a strong rallying cry from the base. It was no more apologizing. It was more of a more of an aggressive. You have a statement of how things should be, and it was all of those things. But it was also included things like culture and heritage Now I know why you want to dio You want to say no. Those words mean X. Don't tell me those words mean this other thing because they don't mean those we mean these words to mean a way of life that includes, let's say, you know, strong family unit things which have nothing to do with race. Don't tell May I'm not the one you have to convince. I'm simply telling you that if you want to lose an election, use those words. I don't care how you define them. I'm just saying that there's our election losing words in my opinion now could it be that those air such strong words for the base that it gets more vote out? And I imagine that that's the calculation. But I think the it also reads the new to the country wrong because none of it needed to be said you could get to the same place without using those words. For example, you could say let us appreciate the history that was not kind, but let's understand it and study it. But let us take the things which have worked well of where our country for hundreds of years and have always worked well and try to build unity around it. And if you said it that way, you could go out and say we think strong family family bonds are good. We think, you know, whatever education, whatever you want to say. So you could say anything you wanted. It was sound unifying. It would also sound perfectly good for Republicans because you'd still say yes. We think your family unit should stay together. You know, we think God helps. Republicans will say, Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about. But if you try to capture all there was concepts which are strong concepts, if you try to capture them in words that the other side says means something else to them. Well, you're not really trying to win. All right, that would be sort of how not to win. Now I realize this There's an argument to be made that other people who should not define what your words mean, if you don't mean them that way. Hey, I don't mean it that way, So why are you taking it that way? I would say that that is a child like view of the world, meaning that our words, Um, if we mean to persuade people we should choose our words carefully. If we don't want to persuade people, we'll go ahead and use whatever word you want. If it's not your intention to change anybody's mind, use anywhere you want. It doesn't matter if other people don't like it. You're not trying to change their mind anyway. But it's the whole point, and I think that is the point in an election is to get people to vote for you. Why would you use the words that guarantee they won't? I don't understand it because there other words that are just as good for your side. Why would you use the words that are only good for your side when their words that are good for your side and the other side seems like a strange choice? And I'll compare the president's approach, which I think you'd agree, seems primarily aimed at the base? Maybe you don't agree, but that's that's my starting point. Compare that to Joe Biden's speech, which he gave sort of his own version of 1/4 of July speech, and I retweeted it without comments because it was good. I could do that right? Is everybody okay with me? Retweeting Biden who? You know, I've endorsed just for my safety, but I don't agree with his policies That will think he's necessarily all there. But I'm allowed to reach we him when he does something good. Right? And I thought he was, uh I thought his Fourth of July message about unity was very good in a Republican way in a Republican way. That's right. Joe Biden did a Republican speech for the Fourth of July. And by that I mean, he did not say you're all a bunch of Racists. He did not say black lives matter. He didn't say that. You just didn't address race at all. He just said Unity, America, America unity were all Americans. It was very Republican. So who was he talking to? Was Joe Biden talking to his base? He was not. Which is interesting. So Biden was trying to persuade Republicans, mostly while Trump was trying to persuade Republicans interesting. Which one of those is the better strategy? I'm not sure we know, but it's interesting that they've chosen those pass because we like we like to see what turns out there was something else that Joe Biden said that I thought was worthy of, uh, tweeting Retweeting. He said, This statement, which I know you disagree with. Okay, all right, so in advance, I know you disagree with the following things that I say and also Joe Biden said, and I agree with him, He said wearing masks is patriotic Wearing masks is patriotic. Do you agree? I totally agree. I totally agree. And I will allow that you might disagree about wearing mess. You might say to yourself, Hey, it's a free country. Am I arguing that you didn't hear me? Argue that right? Did I say that you have to wear a mask? I did not. Did I say that you're a bad person if you don't wear a mask? Did not, did I do not. I don't have any insults for you if you if you choose independence over wearing masks, I have no comment. That's the choice you have. But I would say this. It is a known, understood medical fact I'll call. In fact, they're wearing mass might protect other people. Now, would you call that patriotic? If you're doing something which is a personal sacrifice, something you don't want to dio. It's a personal sacrifice, and you do have for the purpose of protecting other Americans. What would you call that? What do you call it when somebody personally sacrifices for the benefit of other Americans? Patriotic. It's patriotic. I completely agree with Joe Biden. Now, if you disagree with that, let me reiterate. I'm not saying that you're wrong to go without an s. I must say in your own I'm not saying that you can't have a different opinion about the experts opinion of whether is good. Absolutely, you can. I'm not saying that you should curtail your personal freedom just because other people think you should. I'm not telling you that. I'm giving you a personal opinion that if you sacrifice for the benefit of other people and here's the important part, your sacrifice for the benefit of other people might not be guaranteed, meaning that you might say to yourself, I'm not 100% sure this makes any difference at all. Right, because we can't be 100% sure that it works. That mass works. You just you know, the odds are good. So what would you call it if you weren't even 100% sure it made any difference. It was totally what you didn't want to dio is completely a sacrifice. And the only reason you're doing it is to protect other Americans. Patriotic. You may, you may You are welcome to disagree. You're welcome to disagree And I won't even argue with you. It's just my personal opinion of that. So I thought things were calming down for 2020 known. I didn't really think that. But last night Kanye decides that he's in the race. Yea is running now. All we know so far is that he tweeted it Onda. Now we're starting to learn how practical or impractical that is because people who are smarter than I am are doing some Googling and they're saying things like So he says wearing burqas is patriotic. Does that analogy? I think I have toe respond to your bad analogies. Does that analogy makes sense? You think of burqa and a medically required facemasks that might last a few months. Those those are kind of similar to you. Somebody says control. I said you could not wear a mask. What control on my putting on you? No, control. Somebody says I've called this stupid. You're welcome to master a sign of slavery. Something says Fine, no argument. You can have any opinion of that you want. Uh, but you must wear Wes because experts are wrong. 90% of the time, perfectly acceptable is perfectly acceptable for you to say. The experts have been so wrong. I'm not going to do this now. I would have a different opinion, but I'm not gonna tell you. That's an unacceptable opinion. Ah, somebody says they were best to protect themselves. Okay, Sure enough. All right, so none of you had a good comments, but there there were lots of them. I'm sure I missed some of their work. I probably missed all the good ones. All right. Uh, you did not say he'd run in 2020. Well, his tweet did because it said Kanye 2020. All right, So Carney says he's running. Doesn't mean it. Let's get to the questions. Does he mean it? I doubt it. I doubt he means in the sense that he's going to do anything about it, You know, I doubt he's gonna campaign. I doubt he's going to do the paperwork I don't. But just for fun. What if he did? What if God needed win? It looks like they're enough states that you can't win in. You probably couldn't just wind in a straight up way, but if you were right in, let's say, Can you write in anybody you want? I have some questions about that, but I think you could write in anybody, right? Is there a law against writings? So is it technically possible now, even if you want in the voting booth? Apparently, there's another problem. It's a little more technical. You're supposed to have Electoral College people who are basically backing up your vote. I'll give it to you in the non technical way. So if you're running for office and you don't have electors already set up in each state, then even if you win the state, there's nobody to cast your vote because just winning the popular vote or winning the state doesn't get you elected. It's the Electoral College. So if you don't have your own electoral college set up, there's no humans who have that job for you to cast that vote for you. Then maybe there's no way to do it because the system requires those There's Electoral College people to exist now. Could all that be put in place? Probably. I mean, nothing is impossible now. The big question is, if Kanye actually ran, uh, who would he take votes away from? I think he would take them away from the Democrats. Would you agree? Would you agree that Kanye would just completely wipe out Biden's vote? Not completely, but he would take enough of it so it would. It would make the difference. But let's ask this more interesting questions. What if Biden just sort of dropped out? What if Kanye took so many votes away from Biden? The Biden looked at the polls, and he went from a commanding lead over Trump to 20 points behind. Let's say that happened. And then that poll. Those polls showed that for a few weeks in a row, the Carney didn't have a majority. He had a solid choke, but it took Biden down to say 20 points below Trump a few months before the election. What would by then do ask yourself what would buy didn't do well, of course, everybody would say, Kanye, Kanye, get out of the race. You gotta let Biden wind. But, Woody, I don't think you would have announced if he wanted Biden to win. Woody, you don't really announce that you're gonna run for president. If you think the other guy that's already in it is the guy. And again, my guess is that Kanye is not completely serious about running. Maybe you seeing what's gonna happen. And then maybe he'll decide after he sees what the reaction is. I don't know anything's possible that the thing we love about Kanye, among other things, is that he's not predictable. If you were predictable, would you like him as much? No, no. He's an artist all the time, part of being an artist all the time. You not just when you're making a song or you're making some fashion or something. He's an artist all the time, so he's always interesting. He's always surprising, and it's always fresh. You're like, OK, I haven't seen that before. So, predicting what Kanye would do, um, is always a tricky business. Um, but imagine if Joe Biden said, I amount because under these conditions, I don't ever have a chance to win. Good luck, Kanye. Do it you can just imagine that happened. It's not impossible if Biden we're 20 points down a month before the election. And the only way you could get rid of Trump was Kanye being elected. Right? You see it, don't you? If you think he doesn't have a play, he kind of does. Guided does, which is brilliant, because if he doesn't win, nobody's really gonna hold it against them, right? Nobody's gonna say, Yeah, Kanye, you ran for president and you didn't make it, you loser. No, because the way he's doing it, if he's doing it all doesn't look like a regular campaign. It would never be held against him to not be elected president in 2020. But suppose it worked, they could. Is it impossible? Not really. It's not really impossible. And if you saw a straight up election between Kanye and Trump, I actually don't know who would win. Actually, I take it back today would win. I think I knew would win straight up. I think you would. Um, now, here's the other thing that might come with this. I've said before that I didn't think Kanye would run for president in a serious way. and we still don't know how seriously is. But I said I didn't think it because it would be, uh, a demotion. There's nobody else who could run for President Wind. And you look at and say, That's kind of a demotion and I don't mean because Kanye is is famous. Yeah, I don't mean a demotion in that sense, I mean that what he's been doing for the last couple of years, if you haven't been paying attention, as he's been doing, sort of a, um I guess a Christian revival or I don't know what you call it, but he's going very heavily into a spiritual direction. In my opinion, the country needs that more than they need a new president, right, because that's there's sort of a spiritually void or something. Yeah, I'm not a religious person, but even I can feel that people are drifting. They need some kind of a connection to something bigger than themselves is just useful. So could can you be something more than a president? I believe he already is. Could running for president or even teasing that he's running for president, help his real job as a spiritual unifier which is what I think is greater purpose. Could be. I think it's all good. Anything that drives attention to Kanye, it is good for May in the sense that I think it's good for the country. All right. Um, of course I had to announce, Let me give you another way that Kanye could be the kingmaker on yes or no. Whichever way the black vote goes, that will determine the next president. We're all on the same page of that, right? If the black vote moved, you know, en masse to Republicans, which is no. Doesn't look like that's gonna happen. But follow the logic of this. If the black vote went in Mass, let's say 60% of them and voted Republican, It would guarantee Trump got elected. We're all on board, right? That's just math. Likewise, if 95% vote Democrat pretty much guarantees the Democrat will win. So I would say that black voters have complete control of the next president. Am I? Right now? I don't know if the black lives matter. Protesters are quite understanding that they already run the country because they dio in the sense that they get to decide who is president. But as others have said, they have abdicated or they've left free money on the table, meaning that as long as you condemn penned on them voting Democrat nobody has to offer anything that they've given away all their power by being predictable. Democrat voters Now imagine if you will, Kanye enters the conversation. Could Kanye end racism in the United States? Yes, here's how. All right, and I'm not saying he's going to do this. I'm just This is just a mental experiment. Could Kanye end racism without becoming president? Yes, here's how. Okay, a za I've described before. If everybody had a good education, that would still be racism in the world. But you know, you can't get rid of the way brains are organized and let me start with an analogy to soften you up. Let me ask you this. Let's say you had a problem. There's a risk of drowning. What do you do about a problem that's a risk of drowning? And if you live on the planet Earth, there's water all over the place. You got your swimming pools, you get your lakes, you got your streams, you got bathtubs. You've got oceans. There's all kinds of places all over the United States that you can drown, so that's a problem. What are you gonna dio? What one solution would be to remove all the water from Earth, But it's not very practical, is it? You might even call it impossible. The other way to go is to learn to swim or to build a boat or to have some life preservers on you. Now this feels very unfair, doesn't it? Because if you're a person who may or may not drown is a your fault that there's water everywhere. It's not your fault, all right? It's really not anybody's fold. It's just the way it is. So if you can't remove all the water from Earth, the only thing you can do is sort of learn to deal with it. This is much like racism, in my opinion. Racism is everywhere in the world that there are people because bias is built into the way any normal brain is organized. It sees patterns and then acts on the pattern. But the trouble is, we're really bad at recognizing patterns. We can't tell confirmation bias. In other words, a fake pattern from one this actual pattern. We can't tell the difference, and you've seen this 1000 times in 2020 Load people will look at the same news will say, Well, here's the pattern and somebody else will look at and say no. This other pattern is the one that matters were terrible, a pattern recognition. So black lives matter would like to reduce or eliminate racism in this country. Can it be done? No, no, it can't be that you can't even be reduced. It's not possible. The only thing you can do is learn to swim. You can learn to swim. You can't get rid of the water, but you can learn to swim. And so imagine a Imagine Kanye with this proposition again. I'm not predicting anything will happen, but you can imagine Imagine. Kanye says something like this. Here's the deal if you get education right and you can make sure that every poor person but black people was who were talking about. But every poor person can have a real good education, then the perceived racism in a generation will look a lot less because everybody that an employer talks do will be somebody who's well educated. They're not going to say, Well, odds are or anything like that is to say, Hey, well educated kids, they're all good. If you can educate everybody equally, you wouldn't eliminate any racism. But it would be such a better world because you could slice through the racism like it didn't exist. So if you could slice through it like it doesn't exist, is there racism? Well, let me ask you this. Does Kanye experience much racism in his personal life? Things that he has discriminated against because he's black? I don't know. Yeah, there may be things that he feels air offensive, but I don't think racism bothers Kanye. Why is it because racism doesn't exist? No. It's exactly the same everywhere in the world. But Kanye his that bothered by it, It just doesn't affect his life in any way, at least on the big stuff, right? I'm sure their offensive little things and things you imagine and things that are true that are in the, you know, in the noise. Now we can't all become Kanye. If you could become Kanye or Michael Jordan, were Oprah the last thing you worry about in your own personal life is the racism that people are applying to you. It could be annoying. That's not gonna change your income. You're gonna slice through life like it didn't exist. If everybody had a good education, they could do the same thing. So imagine Kanye saying, I'm neither Republican nor a Democrat. But if we don't get education, right for everybody, for everybody being the secret sauce, we're never gonna have a better world. Here's what I proposed that whoever makes the best offer on education, we'll get my endorsement. So imagine. Imagine the Kanye develops enough of a support base that he's actually pulling with, like 20% of the vote. So this is just a mental experiment. He stays in the race. Conceptually. The next pool that comes out says he has 20% support. Well, now you have to listen to it right, because if he decides to endorse somebody, it's going to matter. So now you say, let's say Kanye gets a 20% of the pole and he says, Look, I don't know who is gonna win, but here's my deal for you, America. Republicans give me your best offer for what school would look like for everybody to make sure that you absolutely get a good education. No matter who you are aware your board, What's your proposal? Now? Republicans say something like school choice. They'll say something like charter schools. And guess what? Those things are very popular in the black community. The Republicans have a proposal for education, which is far as I can tell, is far more popular among black voters because what would they like more than a choice of where to go to school? I mean, that's That's pretty pretty high on the list of things that can fix everything right. You get your school right. So imagine Kanye saying, Look, I'm neither Republican nor Democrat. I've got 20% of the vote behind me and get asked for one thing. Tell me what you guys has a proposal, Democrats. Your proposal is that the that the school yo union's own you and you're not going to do a fucking thing. Is that Is that your proposal? It is okay that Republicans, what's your proposal? And I'm not talking about college because any black kid who's got good grades, it's gonna find a way to get to college. You get the training they need or skip college, because maybe it's not so important any more. Learn to code whatever. But you got to get the early school right, you know? So Bernie's talking about free college. Well, that's great. But you got to get the early stuff, right? So if Kanye could say, Here's my deal, I'm gonna go with whoever could fix racism. And the only way to do it is to fix schools and fix it for everybody. You give me the best proposal for that and you have my endorsement. And then Kanye is not technically the president. But he fixes racism in one generation, fixes it, I mean, because if the proposals were good and when I say fix it, I do not mean reduce it because you can't you just make it less important. That's fixing it. All right, um, here's my campaign slogan. I've also announced that I'm gonna run for president. I have a few requirements, so I don't want to do any paperwork. So I have announced on Twitter and running for president. But without the paperwork, Um, I also need to work from home. I'm not about commuting and another big requirement is this is my only policy proposal. All foreign dignitaries have to wear name tags. I'm not gonna memorize all of these names of foreign dignitaries. I'm just not. So it's my one proposal. Just wear name tags. Just just do me a solid only one of your visiting. I also have a campaign slogan that I think I think it's quite good. It goes like this. Black lives matter more than others. Now you might say you some. Whoa, What was Scott? You can't say that. You can't say any group matters more than others. To which I say, Well, I do not need your loser philosophies. I know how they negotiate. Everything's a negotiation in politics, right? Even if you're not calling it a negotiation, it's kind of negotiation. Why would you? If you are selling a product, why would your first offer be the lowest price you're willing to sell it for? Why would your first offer be the lowest price you'd start high and let them negotiate down to a fair price. Right. So all good negotiations starts with a big first. Ask eso I would start start with a campaign slogan of black lives matter more than others. And then when people tried to negotiate me down and have have a room to go down, and then would they get down to say, Hey, how about we just say it's all kind of the same? And that's a you I know I'm willing to listen to that offer, but my first offer is the black lives mean a little worth a little bit extra, a little bit extra. Then people say we can't live with that. That feels like a violation of the Constitution. But can we talk you down toe Teoh even. Can we get you down to equal? I'd be like, uh, I don't know. You sound a little bit racist when you talk like that. Um, but here's what we do now. You see, the less of deals that there could be, uh, things that are a trade off, for example, you have to pay people more to work in a dangerous job. You have to pay people more to work on a holiday. All right, so you can see that discomfort and money can be you substitutes, right? I'll pay you mawr if you'll take a little more discomfort. So There's lots of cases where money is a substitute. So I'll say, Yeah, I'm willing to entertain your offer of bringing my first offer down to roughly equal, but you're gonna have to kick in a little extra. Maybe some better schooling, something. So So I would just be a better negotiator, and I would get all of the black vote that way so I might be your next president If Kanye isn't, um, there was a new fake video, uh, that CNN apparently ran and some others that seemed to indicate that President Trump didn't know that Operation Desert Storm was not in Vienna. Now, of course, it was a deceptive edit, which they finally had to admit it wasn't true. But can we learn? Can we learn from now that, uh, video lies? Can we all agree that video lies and that it lies almost every time? Okay, the lies almost every time. So if you think I saw it with my own eyes is a thing, it's like you missed all of 2020. Anybody who says to you, I know it's true, Scott, I saw on the video If anybody says that your best interests so it looks like you skipped all of 2020 and didn't notice that it, if it's on the video, is probably a lie. That's why it's a viral video. All right. Um, did you see that? Uh, let's talk about a little more on Biden. So I offered a tweet today. I offered a way to take him out of the race and it would look like this. Now this assumes that a reporter can ever talk to him and ask questions. I really that will ever happened. But there are two questions. If EST in this order would take Biden out of the race, ready two questions in this order and it's the order that matters. It's got to be in this order. Takes him out of the race. Number one. Do black lives matter? We assume you'll say yes, Number two. Here's the key question. Do white lives matter? What would Joe Biden say if after you said, do black lives matter? And he said Yes, of course. And then you say, Do white lives matter? What would the answer? Now here's the beauty of it. If he would ask him, do all lives matter, he would know that that trap is coming. And of course, he would be prepared for it, right? I mean, you would be prepared for it and say, Oh, let's not be divisive. Well won't live in a better world blow of law, so he almost certainly would have a response ready. But if you ask them specifically, do white lives matter? What's the answer to that? It's that it's not obvious, right? You would fumble on the answer. And in the fumbling of the answer, you would create the video clip, which would pretty much end his campaign. So here's my supposition that because Biden's mental acuity is in question, and I think it looks like it's obviously less than they used today. If you look at old videos of Joe Biden talking, it's really obvious or something different going on. Um, so if you ask him questions, which are of the type he has answered before during his career, not talking about answered before, as in yesterday, I'm talking about things which he has thought about for a long time. He probably has the right kind of memory capacity toe dredge up some general answer, all right. You could probably generally answer. Um, somebody says, Stop shaving him for stuttering. Well, I've never done that because I don't machine people for stuttering. But, um, any question that he has never seen before a novel question should throw his brain into, um, a reboot. So it so think of it this way. I gave you one specific example of a nonstandard way to ask The question is the standard way would have been Do all lives matter on? Of course, that's racially divisive. But the do white lives matter. You just haven't seen nobody's asked that specific question. So it's the uniqueness of it that would throw him off his game, whether it's this topic or any other, I have some a self defense recommendation for you, and it goes like this. If you accidentally hit a protester with your car in under normal circumstances, you should stop right, because if there's an accident, especially if somebody's hurt, you don't want to leave the scene of the crime. That would be another crime. You want to work it out, but in this specific situation where you hit a protester with your car and there are other protesters which clearly would surround your car and kill you. Can you leave the scene of the crime in that situation, I would say yes, I would say that even if you have somebody with your car, you should get out of there as soon as you can. You want to leave as soon as you can. Now, to protect yourself as soon as you're safe, you want to call the authorities and tell him what happened? I think that would be good enough to protect you. I'm not a lawyer, but I can tell you you're better off dealing with the legal consequences than you are with the mob. That will certainly kill you if you stay around. Even if it was an accident, most of you saw the horrific accident yesterday. There's one fatality. And, uh, it was just horrific. If you've seen the video, um, Joel Pollack had this interesting it twist on two ideas. He put him together, I guess, is his wife. He reports says this. This is his Joel's tweet. My wife's Fourth of July idea put the proposed National Garden of Heroes along the national bicycle path that Scott I was proposed. Now I should remind you that somebody else. Before I had, I thought I had this great idea of a nationwide bicycle path route with lots of lots of support structures that would create lots of jobs around the way. And then you could be a sort of a robot proof business because you would need lots of humans to maintain it no matter what, at least for the foreseeable future. And, uh, and then there's the idea of putting all the statues in the national garden. But what if you let you have the statues, uh, put near the bicycle path or the bicycle path was goes where they already are, so that you would have a continuous history lesson at each stop? So you'd be, you know, on the surface, your bicycle across the country or just some part of the country. You don't have to go the whole way, but every time you stopped, there's a statue. Might be Martin Luther King might be George Washington with some context. Well, he was a slave owner. We don't like that part, whatever you do, but basically make sure that everything's in context. If you want to make sure that you've got the more modern and you non slave owner statues than do that to throw a Columbus and there but gives the full context. Why, no And then, of course, they would be torn down in an hour so wouldn't work. But I think it's always fun to noodle on these kinds of ideas because it might give you ideas for better, better ideas in the movie business that's called the bad idea. So somebody comes up with a bad idea and you know why is bad. But that makes you think more creatively, and you end up with a way. Wait. If you changed it a little bit, it would work. That's that's what they're would be the good welcome. All right, if I talked about everything, have I talked about everything? That's so how would you make it flat? Excellent question. And I mentioned that before your bike path would not need to be flat everywhere. It could be flattened parts based on just the local topography, but because the electronic bikes are now, they've gone from maybe a novelty. Teoh. I own one now, and it's completely changed his transportation. I won't go into my long sales pitch on that, but with the elect Electric bikes. The given assist to your pedaling The hills don't really matter. So even at my age, there's no hill in my neighborhood. I live in it really Hilly. I've been a really hilly place that were there really steep hills where I live. They just disappear with an electric Elektronik like So there'll be more of those. And you could probably Wrentham. You wouldn't. You wouldn't have to bring it with you. You just rent it on site, just like any rental car at said Ross. Um, they there in the range of Yes, they could be Ford eight or $12,000. Mine might cost $4000. My guess is that it will be 1000 in a few years. Yeah, probably in three years will be $1000 then you still might not want to own one. But it's a very economical thing to rent. You know, if you're renting $1000 item, probably doesn't cost you that much per day. All right, that's all for now. And I will talk to you tomorrow
