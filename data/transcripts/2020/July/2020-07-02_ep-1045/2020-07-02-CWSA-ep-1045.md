don't dump. Hey, everybody. Wow. Quite a few people here. This is something I said. 01 of fun Day. Today is one of the best days. Sounds like employment numbers are up. Yeah, we'll do the simultaneous up. Let's let the people pour in here for a moment. Um, employment numbers. Air up shop has been dismantled. Gillian Maxwell has been apprehended. The economy is starting to scream. Corona virus deaths are down. Things were opening up. I don't know. May be good news everywhere, But first, before we get to that, you know what you need to do. You need to grab yourself a couple of Moger glass. A tanker tells or style that canteen jug or flask of vessel of any kind filled with your favorite liquid. I like coffee and enjoyed me now for the dopamine hit of the day. The thing that makes everything better. And I think you can see it in in the world already. It's already working. It's called the simultaneous Happen. It happens now. Go. Mm. Delightful. Sublime. Excellent. 321 Until Scott tells us we're wrong, they glean Maxwell was arrested. Well, I believe she was arrested. I believe she waas. So the simulation has delivered to us once again. Entertainment. It's nonstop. How much do you want to know what delayed? Maxwell is gonna tell you when she's cuts a deal that the most exciting news day you'll ever have will be this headline. Gillian Maxwell cuts a deal. Can you imagine? I don't know if she can. I've got a feeling she may not survive the incarceration process, but we'll see what happens. All right, Eso The chop was dismantled. The Capitol Hill, uh, occupied people or whatever it was. And were you surprised that there was no real violence when they got cleared out? What do you think of that? Have I ever told you about the fake? Because So that's a term I part of it. And it's based on the book Influence by Jill Dini, which he talks about a experiment in which you can prove that people will do things just because you said, because our brains are wired in a way that when you hear the word actually just the word because your brain says, Oh, there's a reason because the word because is there and you can use the word because and then add nonsense after it A people will still, at least in the statistical way, will be more likely to give you what you want just because you use the word because I've taken that have extended it to the concept that you're not using the word but you're giving somebody a reason that they wanted a reason to do something. Now, let me let me give this out for you. So, in my opinion, the mayor of Seattle, Jenny Durkin, played this brilliantly that I know most of you are going to disagree with this, but in my opinion, this could not have been played better. Honestly, it was one of the most masterful examples of leadership uh, I've ever seen. Now there's another interpretation which fits the facts, Justus. Well, remember, you got to movies going out here. They both fit the fax because the other the other set of facts would be, uh, she didn't care about any of this until they started threatening her own personal residence, at which point she got mad. Then please clear them out. But here's how I see it. And I said this from the start eso from day one I was on the side of no. Lets us play out a little bit. Let it play out a little bit, because if you do it right away, the energy is too high and you just cause theon to nitty form or Death and mawr videos of police beating people up in resistance and God knows what. So if the police had acted aggressively on day one or two or three, you don't know what would have happened. But it all likelihood, because the temperature was so high in terms of people's attitudes, it was very likely going end no well and spark more protests, which themselves would end well. So if you're trying to well protests across the country, the last thing you want to do is go hard the first moment you can, you want to let the temperature come down a little bit and then you could go through. So here's my hypothesis that by letting the proof the occupiers in shop experience the life, which they did not intend to be permanent, the people who know occupied it, they didn't They didn't start out the month and say, I think I'll go live in a tent on the street somewhere with no shower. I think the longer they stay there, the more they wanted wait for it. Ah, fake. Because they needed a reason to leave that they could say it wasn't our choice. You see where I'm going? They all wanted to leave by the time the police asked them to leave. Now I say all, obviously nothing applies to everybody. But you know what I mean? That the mood there almost certainly because the mayor had waited long enough. This is the brilliant part, in my opinion. All right. Now, for those of you keeping score and my net, Am I not calling a Democrat mayor? Brilliant for a specific piece of strategy and persuasion, Right? So for those of you were gonna attack me later, blah, blah, blah Europe, President Trump's ass. You just saying good things about him. You're in the tank. Just listen to me for a while. I think this was brilliant leadership because she took the temperature down by agreeing with him. She called it the Summer of love. She was completely non threatening and it took the energy out that had to be done. You had to reduce the energy, and she did it simply by not not creating a counter force that would cause them to get work up again once they had experienced living there for a while. However many weeks, it waas, you know, they wanted to leave, you know, again, not every single person, but, you know, they did not want to live there for the rest of their lives. What they needed, they really needed was for their mayor to give them a fake. Because a reason to leave that didn't look like they had made their own decision. And she did. So the police came through. Um, they're very little video of it. The video we got was not from the major news outlets. I think it looks like the media kept a lid on this story or they couldn't report it. I don't know. It's one of those, um, but I don't In terms of reporting where there any casualties? I think they cleared the entire chop. Correct me if I'm wrong. Because the reporting is pretty sketchy. Um, so whoever said wrong with Scott at all caps, you might be new here because what happens when you say wrong? Scott in all caps. Well, I think the other people I couldn't tell you. All right. So blocked, you got blocked. There's always there's always space for reasons. Um, so you can give them, um So that's my take. Now the other take which fits the facts, Justus. Well, so let me let me give attention to the alternative movie here. Which one of these fits the facts? The best three other one is that she is an incompetent Democrat mayor who botched it from the beginning. Because if she had been tougher in the beginning, they wouldn't have taken over the chop in the first place. Um, and that the only reason that she got tough in the end and had them cleared out is that she only cared about herself because they threatened her own home. And then it became serious. Ter. Now does that fit all the facts? It does. It does, doesn't it? If it's, um, completely just it it fits him as well as my description did. So if you're gonna pick which of those is the real one, here's how you would do it. You would say to yourself, Let's make a prediction from both of these two movies. My movie says this mayor is a smart operator, which would predict you will see future smart things coming from her right now. If the other movie is correct and she is just thoroughly incompetent and selfish or something, then you would expect that she would not do clever things in the future. So let's watch. If I'm wrong, I would completely be open to that because I'm just saying that this view of the world fits, you know, the movie fits doesn't mean is right. We'll see which one predicts, That's how you know. All right, um, So yesterday I was telling you that Trump's, uh, let's say silence about masks was disqualified, meaning that you can't really support a president. It was not pushing. Masks were promoting the use of masks during a pandemic. It's disqualifying. Yeah, I have been the biggest. I've been the biggest Trump supporter around in terms of his technique, more so than policy. But in terms of him personally, this tactic I've been one of his biggest supporters, and even I would say if he's not promoting face mask during a pandemic that's disqualifying seriously, that's pretty disqualifying. Um But yesterday he did. Now you could say to yourself, I didn't. He didn't come down strong. He just sort of said they're a good idea. He'd wear it in certain circumstances, etcetera. But the news is reporting it that the president is probe. Ask now, I don't think he was ever anti mask, but it was coming off that way. So? So he's sort of lukewarm. Tepid. Uh, masks are a good thing. I suppose that's a good place to be. Uh, I got a message from Vladimir Putin yesterday. Not directly, uh, in which the message waas that Russia wants to be in an ally with the United States to team up against China. Do you believe that? Do you believe that Putin sent me a message that Russia wants to be friends with the United States against China? Well, if you're a subscriber to the locals platform, you know what I'm talking about. The rest of you should just assume it didn't happen. Um, so, um, I don't know if you heard. I made a little news yesterday. Uh, quite a bit of news with the AOC play now. Those of you who were with me from the beginning of this. This play got to watch it unfold. Now here's the background. Uh, you remember when ABC said we have 12 years left before climate change kills us? She never really said that, but it was interpreted that way when she said was, If you don't get really serious the next 12 years, you know the future doesn't look so good. But it got turned into simplified Teoh. You're all dead in 12 years now. Air Sea, as I've said from the beginning, noticed persuasion. And it was really, really good persuasion because it made you focus on it. And it made you you look at her first offer. The first offer was so extreme that whatever comes after, that doesn't seem so big anymore, which was perfect, right? So if you so she says you're gonna be dead in 12 years. She never really said that. She never said that, but that's how it's interpreted. So she allowed that interpretation in a sense, allowed it by not pushing back as hard as she could. And and that just brings attention to her topic. What? What? What do I teach you about personal Asian? 50% of persuasion is getting people's attention because you can't persuade if they're not paying attention. That's that's basic. If you don't get people's attention, you're not persuading. So she does that better than just about anybody in the world. And she got your attention climate change. And then then you're already primed for her persuasion. So it worked really well. Now the thing that works about that is that the claim cells ridiculous. Unbelievable. At the same time that let me explain that, so to say that we have 12 years to get this writer world, we're all going to die is both ridiculous, like just not a surface, you say. Well, that doesn't sound right, but at the same time is completely believable that somebody believes it. In other words, even if you don't believe it, you you are convinced that somebody else does believe it. That's the magic sauce. If you get that combination right, you could have a viral everything, and your message will be the one that people focus on. So I borrowed that technique and I told you I was boring. So those of you were watching this develop. You know that I told you I was doing this right? So this better. This is an accident. And what I told you is that, uh, that I told you, I think soon after I done it that I had tweeted that if Biden is elected, there's a good chance you'll be dead in a year. Do you see? You see, that's the same as a receives play. The 12 years you'll be dead. Now, when you hear you hear me say this, there's a good chance you'll be dead in a year. If Biden is elected, what are the two things you think? If you're let's say you're a Democrat, the first thing you think is that's ridiculous, right? Just like you said will be dead in 12 years from climate change. That's ridiculous. So that's the first part that what's the second part? That somebody believes it's true. So when they read this, do they think that Republicans, or even than I believe it's true? Yeah, yeah, they acted like they acted exactly like that. So they fell into the AOC trap. I guess I was trending on Twitter for a while. Uh, and I was the subject of many articles yesterday. Hit pieces of course, I didn't read any of them. I just looked at the titles. I always think it's funnier if somebody writes a hit piece about me and I don't read it. For some reason, that's funnier. I'm the only one who gets the joke. It's like, Ah, your roadie happiest about me and I didn't read it because I'm actually not interested. It's actually easy to do. If I were interested, it would be hard to not read it. But I'm actually not interested. I'm not literally just I look at the articles and I think I got better things to do than reading it. My favorite troll yesterday was he tweeted something that he thought was an insult, And I just retweeted it because it was such a weak attack that I just I think it'll amplify it. And I'll tell you, there's nothing more humiliating than thinking you're attacking a public figure and they just retweet it without a comment. No comment. It all just retweeted that says, hard as you can fail in your criticism if the target of your criticism says, I think I'll retweet this So I did that yesterday to the entertainment of some of my followers. You noticed. All right, So here's the argument that backs up now now gonna go full aoc for you. So AOC Once she has your attention, we'll give you her argument about climate change. So now that I have people's attention about this, you might get hunted down. If you're a Republican, I will give you my argument because that I have your attention now, not you, because most of you are kind of Trump's sports. But if it But what I'm trying to do is attract attention from the people who are not by natural audience and controversy does that really well? But it's not a controversy that's not grounded, in fact, and by fact I mean, um, statistical likelihood, that is to say, nobody can predict the future, no matter how well you watch me do it, it doesn't mean I'm going to do it right the next time. All right. Predicting the future, I would say I have the best track record of any public figure. It's hard to compare, but at the moment, probably right out there in the top 10% at least of people were predicting what's gonna happen. I get my share wrong, but as does everybody, um, but nobody can really predict the future. You could only say, Well, my best guess is that the odds of this happening is a little more than the odds of this or that happening. So that is the context in which I said There's a good chance that if Biden gets elected, you'll be dead in a year now. Is you. You? Of course, I was speaking on Twitter's. It was Trump supporters because that's 95% of my audience on Twitter. So is it true that there's a chance? And I said a good chance that you would be hunted if you're a Trump supporter and by then gets into office? Let me support, uh, let me support that assertion. I remember. The assertion is not that it will happen. The assertion is that there's a good chance that will happen now. You're smart enough to know the distinction between there's a chance of something happened in a good chance of something happened versus I predict it will happen. That's very different. Okay, so there are multiple things that could happen. One of them, which you must guard against, looks like this, Biden becomes president and Democrats now being sort of in power. Let's say Congress is old Democrat, too. First of all, is that possible? Well, according to the polls, that's what's gonna happen. So so far that looks like a reasonable future, right? A good chance that Biden will be elected just based on the polls. Now if he's elected, is he going to go hard against police? I'm sorry. Is he gonna go hard against protesters? Once he gets elected? It's possible it's possible. Joe Biden could actually be the one who goes hard against protesters because maybe maybe a Democrat can, you know, without causing all the races and problems. Or maybe Kamila Harris can. If she's the rial power beyond the presidency at the time, that's the other possibility. But let's just game out the different possibilities. One possibility is that Biden is president, and they just sort of don't support the police against the protesters. The protesters would continue to do what they dio causes working. Nobody. Nobody stops doing things that work, So if the protesters say, Hey, we're gaining ground and nobody is stopping us, they're going to keep going. So what does that look like? Well, I interviewed yesterday a young woman who lost her job because her co workers found an old tweet from 2010 that said she liked Donald Trump, 2010 was before he was even running for president, and there was some other little clues they thought they found to suggest that she was a Trump supporter, which was certainly not any over the things she was doing and that lost her job over it. How common is that? Well, let me ask you, Can you put on a maga hat and walk through an urban area without being assaulted? Not really. If you put on a any kind of a had or trump sticker or anything that suggested you were a Trump supporter and went into a crowded area, wouldn't you expect to be assaulted? You would expect that right? I'm almost guaranteed. So if you have a world where people are already losing their jobs for being trump, supporters cannot, in a public space, have any indication on them that their trump supporters without being assaulted. It's very like very much like being Jewish in in Hitler's Germany, isn't it? If you are, I don't know what that was like. But if you were, if you were Jewish and Hitler's Germany, you probably didn't want to go outside wearing clothes that broadcast that you were Jewish. I'm sure some people did, but you probably would prefer people didn't notice if that was possible, because you might get some abuse. So it's somewhat like that to be a Republican. Now if you're Democrat, do you see that? That's the sort of invisible to you, wouldn't you say? I would say Democrats are completely unaware. That's been my observation that the rank and file ordinary Democrats are completely unaware of how much pressure is being put on Trump supporters. Economically employment wise socially, um, and and risk of violence, risk of assault. So is it a big, isn't it? Or is it a really big leap to say that if the protests continue the way they're going that they would be hunting down Republicans again? I didn't say that will happen. It's not a prediction, I said. There's a good chance it is one of the It's one of the baby three paths that are about equal possibility right now. Now one of my critics tweeted that I don't understand what black lives matter based want. Basically, they just want better policing and, you know, less discrimination. And doesn't everybody want that? To which I said, I don't think you're listening to the interviews and the speeches given by the black lives matter leaders, because here's what the message has morphed into. First of all, you've heard Hawk Newsome on CNN. I think CNN might have been in Fox News, but he's been on a few things. So he's a leader of black lives matter in New York. And he said directly that violence is still on the table now. And what he said was, We need this revolution could be violent, could be nonviolent. And he wasn't he wasn't picking a favorite. Basically, yeah, three implication is then, if they don't get what they want with non violence than violences is warranted because the problem is big enough and violence is always the way the society changes. That's essentially Hawks argument if I've captured right, so he does not say I prefer violence. But he also doesn't say I didn't hear him say he preferred not violence, sort of silent on the preference. He's just saying that they have an end goal, whatever that looks like, and that they are somewhat, um, agnostic about whether violence is part of it. If it has to be asked today and on. I think Hawk is correct when he says, Historically, people don't be hypocrites because basically the whole country was founded on violence. Everything you have came from violence. So don't be so surprised if there's more of it in the future. That's actually a perfectly valid statement. So let's take black lives matter leader Hawk Newsome at his word. The violence is on the table if they don't get what they want for Nonviolence now, I would say that would be true of every army, wouldn't you say? And every terrorist, every terrorist, I think would agree with what Newsom said. Violence is on the table, but if we can get everything we want without Nonviolence, so we'll do that, Yeah, why wouldn't we? Of course. So Al Qaeda and black lives matter basically have the same philosophy about violence, which is if I don't need it. If I don't need it, what's the point? But if I do need it, it's on the table. Same as a terrorist. Um, so and then, here's the other change. So it seems like a month ago white supremacy meant one thing, but it's it's sort of morphed where it could be that I'm just learning how other people see the word. I don't know which one it is. But here's the change. That might just be in my understanding that I've seen in the last several weeks Used to be the white supremacists were people who believed they were superior out of because there d a or whatever. Um, I've argued that I've never met one. I just don't know anybody who thinks that and that it must be something trivial part of the country if I have never met. So I've never even seen one, really. I mean, I've never even seen one on television, and I'm talking about I say never. I mean, let's say last five years I've never seen Look who met the definition, in my opinion of thinking that because they were white, they were superior to other races. That's how I used to define wait supremacy as which is different from being a racist and different from being a white nationalist. A special kind of racist. Um, they don't They don't require the supremacy park. If you're just a regular Racists, you have a preference. But it's not because you think you're superior. Okay, so that's a distinction. And I thought that mattered. But it turns out I was listening to a speech and he was in L. A. One of the black lives matter leaders was talking to the audience with a microphone. And the way blood, the way white supremacy seems to be used at the moment is simply a description of a system the supports white people better than other people, and that if the current system, all the systems, the United States, from judicial system to economic system to you name it, um that all of them support way people staying the dominant economic power, mostly economic but political to in the country. Or more economic, I think, because politically we did. We did have eight years of the black president, so that's pretty good. Politically. So, um, so here's your situation. It looks like waste supremacy. The definition of has changed from a small group of white people who think they're superior to everybody else, which is basically a vanishing breed. Never seen one in five years. It that's changed to waste. Supremacy means if you're white and you're in a system that keeps you in a good place, Visa vee compared to other people, you're you're away, supremacist. So you would be a white supremacist simply by being white and being part of a system that's good for you. So I'm white and a part of a system that seems to be good for May capitalism, etcetera, if you are also white and you're part of a system that other people think is good for you, and I think they'd be corrected that it does the system pretty much every system is built maintaining the status quo. So I think there's something to that. So here's the thing. If violence is on the table and the only thing that you can do to get rid of white supremacy is too, dismantle the systems and we see that you can't wear trump hat with being without being assaulted, and you see that you can't assume that you will remain employed if you're a Trump supporter. Given all those things, is that is it? Is it a stretch to say we could get to the point of violence against, uh, just white people for being white because they're white supremacists. Let me say in the fast way, if you label somebody a white supremacist in 2020 you you are marking them as a target for violence. Does anybody disagree with that? That if you label somebody away, supremacist in 2020 you are giving a explicit, I would say explicit approval for violence. Anybody disagree with that? It is approval. So, um, anybody who hasn't listened to black lives matter rhetoric both in the interviews and also in the public speeches. I don't think they know what's coming because what's coming is, um, not oh, thank you for changing those those regulations about policing. That's not really what they're asking for. That was the spark, but has nothing to do with police reform. If I had anything to do with police reform, the Democrats and the Republicans would be negotiating on the bills that have been proposed, but they don't even want to. The Democrats literally don't even want to solve police reform, which looks like you would be trivially easy to at least have improvements because the Republicans are already on board and say, Hey, bring out of the conversation. So what you have to understand is that black lives matter wants to dismantle white supremacy, which they consider the entire system. And if you happen to be one of the people who doesn't want that to happen and you've been labeled a white supremacist and violence is on the table explicitly on the table, it is explicitly on the table. Is that a stretch to say that one of the three passes that Trump's supporters will be hunted? It's not. It's not even a prediction, because it's already happening. Trump supporters are already being hunted. You don't believe me. Uh, why don't you wear a wear a mask that makes you look like Jack Sebek who may be watching this right now, Jack, that where a mass that makes you look like somebody was associated with, You know, the right and, uh, conservatism. And go to go to a rally, just just walk into a rally, just being yourself. But being a recognizable supporter of the president, that's all. You don't have to cause trouble. You don't have to get in anybody's face, simply exist in the same physical location as the black lives matter. Protesters, Will you be assaulted? Yeah, 100% that. Would you say that's not hunting Republicans. I'm not making a fucking prediction. It's not a fucking prediction. It's happening right now. If you don't understand that the Republicans are already being hunted. You're not really current. You may be locked in a Democrat silo in which you're only seeing your own news. But good luck. Just just try putting on your Jack Pacific disguise. You know, in other words, looking like him walking into a black lives matter rally. And you can even you could even hold a sign that says black lives matter. You could even chant with them. They will still beat your ass or try to or threaten you, or assault you or throw something on you, which would be a soul. All right, so I have a lot of fun. I've grown more Twitter followers in the last 24 hours than any other 24 hours. So, um, what I'm watching is a lot of people who are watching what I'm doing because I think you understand. This audience understands that this is a performance. I'm not doing individual things of doing a group of things which I'm stringing together. And if you don't see that I'm building a thing, then you're missing the best part of the show. So every time I draw in my trolls and my critics, every time they write a hit piece about me, I grow stronger. Now, this doesn't work for everybody. I don't recommend it. If you just have a vanilla job and you you want to stay out of trouble, don't do what I do because of looking for trouble, because I can convert the energy into something productive. You can't. Alright, some you can. Maybe. But I wouldn't try it. I wouldn't try it. The odds of me being canceled or prairie high, But I like danger sometimes. Um, you know what's, uh, fascinating is we're watching the mother's. There's some talk about the, uh, Mount Rushmore because two of the presidents on Mount Rushmore were slave owners, and a lot of Republicans were joking just a week ago. Was like, Ha ha, ha. Next, they're gonna come after about Rushmore. Well, it turns out about Rushmore is now in the crosshairs for exactly the reason do you think Now, uh, uh huh. What do you think about that? I was thinking maybe we should put George Floyd up there instead because you could you could change one of the faces, Let's say George Washington and replace him with George Floyd. A bit like that idea. You could probably, you know, carving a little bit. I have toe might recess in a little bit because you have tow change too many things in the face. But you could I think you could make yourself a proper George Floyd because as a scandalous Owens provocatively points out, uh, she complains that since she was black, she can say things like you say. But Kenya says that black people should have better role models. And I think, Well, that shouldn't that apply to everybody? Shouldn't everybody have better role models? Do you want George Washington to be your role model when he was a slave owner, Kind of ambiguous, but we've We've been told that George Floyd's you know, whatever else he did in his life that maybe you don't approve of is not relevant. And so, uh, unlike George Washington, where he has to be considered as a whole, which would make him a racist. And it would, Of course, that's just a fact. Um, we don't have to do that with George Floyd. We should We should see him as a sympathetic character. And I thought, Well, why not take it to the next level? Why not take it to the next level? What about Russia? What, you don't like that idea? Uh, such a good idea. Don't say racist things. I have to block you for that. Sorry. You can't be here saying stuff like that. All right. Um, will they make a play for Mount Rushmore? Maybe. We'll see. Um, I thought it was interesting watching the black lives matter. People say F Eric Garcetti, correct me if I'm wrong. But isn't Eric Garcetti the most accommodating white man you've ever seen in your life? If you haven't been watching? So he's mayor of Los Angeles, and Eric Garcetti has been absolutely pro black. Lives matter from from the jump. He's a Democrat. Knows what. His base watts. He's been completely underside and, you know, doing the minimal that I guess the mayor needs to do. But he's unambiguously on their side. So What do the black lives matter? People say about white Eric Garcetti, who is completely on their side? Fucking They were chanting it. They're chanting, uh, fuck Eric Garcetti, his all in on their side And they were chanting, F him Now the issue is, as I said before, he's part of the whole system. In other words, you can't You can't take him and treat him separately is part of the system as well and that the system is white supremacy. So it doesn't matter if he says all the right things. And even if he does all the right things, he's still part of a system that has to be dismantled. If you're Eric Garcetti, do you say to yourself, You know, if these black lives better, people get everything they want. I'm safe. Is Eric Garcetti personally safe? Let's say, career wise, let's say economically, maybe even physically. If black lives matter, did get everything they want. Remember, Black lives Matter is a group that Eric Garcetti very much approves off and supports. So if the group they used approves of and supports gets what they want, what would happen to Eric Garcetti? What would happen to Eric Garcetti is exactly what black lives. Matter is telling you he'd be fucked. They chanted it. You don't have to guess what they're thinking. If a crowd chance Fuck Eric Garcetti Boyd out. Listen to him. Was it not Maya Angelo? Who said If somebody tells you who they are, you should listen to them. Black lives matters tell you who they are. And they're saying that this white guy who is absolutely completely on their side is going to get fucked because he's a white guy and he's part of the way supremacist system. Um, so you got that, uh, Michigan State University? They pressured Stephen Su h s u I don't know if I could pronounce his name right. I think it's Sue to resign from his position as vice president research. Uh, because he talked about some research that came from that university, it wasn't his own. So he was referring to in a tweet, I guess some research that his own university did, but not him. It wasn't anything he was involved with. They showed that, uh uh todo that wasn't much difference between police shootings of black and white Americans. So just referring to research from his own institution got pressure to leave his position. S has vice president of research now. Now, apparently, he also was accused of some tweet about genetic differences. And the context which they leave out is that that's his field. His field is genetics. That's like his field. So he tweeted out something from his field and he's gonna lose his job for it wasn't It was something you did. It was just something you talked about in his field. All right, so I guess you can't Do you talk about stuff without getting canceled? Uh, let's see what else we got going on. You know, the hardest part about our politicians handling the protests and the occupied zones is that nobody and also the Corona viruses. The same problem is that we don't let leaders do, uh, do math with people's lives. And that's the whole job. The job of a leader is to make hard decisions in which you know that no matter which way you go, somebody's going to die. But it will be different people, depending on the path you take and you're only trying to have the fewest of them die. If you can. So leaders air, usually choosing among pass which somebody's gonna die, you know, even the social stuff. Not just international war stuff, but even social stuff. If you don't have enough of a social net, people die. Um, for example, So with the Croat A virus, the thing that Trump can't say the thing that Republicans can't say, The thing that no politician can say is this because this is what a leader would say. Here's the deal. The economy is just another way of expressing lives. In other words, if I say GDP of 1% you could translate late that directly into saved 10,000 lives or whatever it ISS, because economics and people living or dying are so connected that it's almost like just another word for how many people survive. So if you were a real leader, you would say something like this. We'd like to reopen the state. We know infections will continue to go up, but it will be good for the economy and the reason we're doing this. It seems cruel because it's good for the economy, which seems like cold capitalist thinking, but actual real people will die. Your grandmother might die if we make this decision. But I, as a leader have decided that people will also die if the economy is bad. It's a takes a little longer. But even more people could die if we don't get our economy going. So I've decided that if 20,000 people have to die because of Corona virus But the benefit will be opened in the economy by by hunches because I can't prove it. My huh, Judge, is it? I'll save more than 20,000 people but different people by doing this. So, yes, I'm making a decision which 20,000 people are going to die who would not have died if we had stayed closed, but theoretically, because we get to a vaccine someday. Maybe, but I'm going to make a decision. 20,000 people might die, but I think we're still going to come out ahead because we'll save more than 20,000 byte having a functioning economy. Now that's what I That's what a leader needs to say. But you would lose your job immediately upon saying that. So we have citizens do a terrible job of supporting our leaders because we can't let our leaders say the truth. You can't and being prompted. There's I forget where it waas. But there was a statue of an elk. Yeah, OK, and help. You know, big animals there was set on fire and to feast, I guess, because it was a statue. And I agree with that because I went to an Elks Club meeting once they were all white. So I get why they're getting rid of those Ellicott statues, even if they're not related to the Elks Club. It just, you know, symbolism. Symbolism is important. So you also the story about the recent Harvard graduate, a woman who said she wanted to stab anybody who said All lives matter Trump supporters mostly. And that caused closer to lose her job at Deloitte. Uh, and she was back up, still crying about it. Now have they lowered the standards for Harvard? Because you would expect somebody from Harvard somewhere in the educational process. You think somewhere they would have been taught, don't go on social media and threatened to kill your political rivals by stabbing them to death. It's just not really good for your future employment, but I guess that didn't come up. Now here's what I think this really tells you. Imagine somebody going through Harvard and then doing this video saying that she wanted to literally stab Trump supporters and, you know, did the motions stab, stab, stab, and she was actually very angry. And tell me, how could you go through that whole process and not know that that would get you in trouble? It has to be that she had been so so in a bubble of like minded people that she literally couldn't imagine that there was somebody else in the world who was seeing the video, that they might not appreciate the enthusiasm with which she would like to see them killed. I mean, if you assume that her I q is probably very high because she got into Harvard, right? These air, not dumb people. Harvard does not produce dumb people. That just doesn't happen. So the only X explanation is that she was in such a bubble. She just didn't even know the other world existed in which is tragic in their case. So I think Harvard failed her hard and that Coster, um, here's a story of ah, racist story of a guy named Palm Accounts used African American man who walked into an Ohio bank recently clutching, They say his first paycheck. Why do you have to say clutching? That's racist? So the story itself is racist, You know. He's not clutching his first paycheck. He has a paycheck. How about that? But what if he's a black man? He's clutching it. No, I don't think he was clutching his paycheck. He just had it. What is the bank? All right, so that's my rent. Eso He got a new job in Electric Company. Took in his first paycheck was $1000 and the teller called the police. So the story is racist. Teller calls the police black man who's just trying to cash a check. I just tried the cash. A check. Now, what is it? They don't tell you with this story? Well, that's why I'm here. Because I used to be a bank teller. I have refused to cash the checks for white people. Allow me to tell you the following story very much like this, but without the calling the police part. Well, that was a bag teller. Man walked into the into my by branch. Put a check on the counter, and I think it was like $5000 or something and which was a lot of money back in that day and those days. And I asked him if he had an account at my bank, and he said he did not. Then I asked him that I asked, uh, you know, he wanted the check you want to. Cash was too big for my level of approval as a teller because he didn't have an account. But the check he was cashing did have an account. So that's why you go to that bank. Is that that's the bank where the money is coming from and sometimes you could cash it there. So I said, I can't cash this check for you, but I'll together I'll get a manager to see if they can. So I get a manager and he waits patiently, and I weighed on other customers while he's waiting for the manager and he's just waiting, waiting just perfectly. Nice guy just waiting and manager comes over and she approves that. I pay him his money and afterwards my manager comes over and she says, Um, do you know whose check you just refused to cash. They go, Not really. I mean, I looked at his name because that was part of the process. But you don't really register names when you're a teller. They're just, you know, it's just information flight by and she goes, You just refused to cash a check for a Bill Packard, the founder of Hewlett Packard, one of the richest men in the country. You just refused to cash his check. You know why I didn't trust him? I didn't trust him. I did not trust a billionaire white guy because he didn't bank in my bank. I'm sorry. Now keep that in mind. Now here's the story of a guy who also did not bank at the bank. Same as same as the billionaire I turned down. So if he was turned down or or somebody went to the manager, you'd say that's just part of the process, right? That's not racist. But whereas I did not call 911 for Bill Packard, this teller did call and said, quote, I have a customer here. He's not our customer, Jack, actually, she says, and he's trying to cash a check, and the check is fraudulent. it does not match our records. What's that mean? Now, If you've been a bank teller, let me tell you what it means. The check was written on account from that bank. The bank teller has access to the records of that account. So the teller looked at the check, looked at the number on the check, looked at the amount of the check, and then presumably, you know, check the numbers on her list. Maybe it was out of order. Maybe there was something irregular. There was something with that the teller checked that tipped her off. That the check was fraudulent. Was it, for example? Ah, $100 check that had a zero added. That probably can't happen. Was there something about it that didn't look right? There was just a mistake. Because if it was just a mistake, like there was something hinky about the check, but it was otherwise fine. Was she allowed to call 911 and announce a crime? Maybe that might have actually been. That might have been, uh, that might have been the actual process. So when you hear the story, the part this left out is why did the color Why did the bank teller call 911? You don't call the bank teller. The bank teller does not call the police unless it's obviously a crime. You don't call the police because black people cash checks. This story is racist shit because it's not true. It's just not true the meaning that the context is left out of why the teller thought there was a crime. It doesn't have anything to do with black. It was a check, either. This check looks like it. It works, you know, in other words, is compatible with the records and what you know or it doesn't have nothing to do with the race of the person. They're nothing, and any bank teller will agree with me. I ask anybody who's done the job of a bank teller. Do you think that's a racist story? Or there was just something wrong with the check. 100% of the tellers will say, Well, if there was something wrong with the check, which we still need to find out. By the way, if there was something wrong with the check, that's kind of the end of the story, because do you know what happens to a bank teller if they cash a bad check. Let me ask you, Do you know what happens to a bank teller? I just took my ring off for typing. Somebody's asking me about my ring. Yeah, it's still getting married. Don't worry. Uh, but it's hard to It's hard to type sometimes with the ring. Do you have that problem? This this finger doesn't feel like it's flying free sometimes would have typing. Um, well, get used to anything anyway, So that's a fake reason story. You can ask any bank teller to find out. All right, um, now, I think I have done everything I wanted to do. Here, let me just see if there's anything else to talk about. I don't think so. All right. I think we had a live points. Anything. I missed the blame. Maxwell story will be just so tantalizing, but we're not gonna know anything for a long time. I'll bet. Um, I need more practice. The alligator used to it. I think I just have to get used to it, but I was actually hitting the wrong keys. Actually get the wrong keys because it's sort of a think ring. Finish your thought. I think I finished it. All right. Hard to rock. Climb with the ring. All right, That's all I got for today, and I will see you tomorrow.
