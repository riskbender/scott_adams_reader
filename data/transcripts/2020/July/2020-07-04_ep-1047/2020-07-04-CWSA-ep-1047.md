something from Hey, everybody, Come on in. Come on in. We've got things to talk about. Yeah, Today, the fourth joy. Oh, yeah, it is. Happy Fourth of July. Do you know the last time I knew what day of the week it waas or what time of the month it waas? It was a long time ago. Or as I said to Christina just yesterday Kill you. Remind me when we're supposed to get married. I have this calendar problem, so it's a lifelong problem. But anyway, I know why you're here. Yeah. Yep. It's for all the father in the simultaneous hip. And all you need is a couple of Munger last attacked her, tells her side that can t jug or flask a vessel of any kind. Fill it with your favorite ligament. I like coffee. Enjoy me now for the unparalleled pleasure. The dopamine here, the day, the thing that makes everything, including the Corona virus better. It's called the simultaneous. It happens Now go. Oh, here's a question for you Just to blow your mind. You want your mind blown? Have you noticed that? Uh, it seems like when there's one crisis in the news and that's the focus of the news. All the other problems go away. You noticed that. Do you see a lot of people complaining about climate change? No. So much. And that's a little lesson for you on how this objective your experiences. Because if we did not have a Corona virus and we did not have whatever the protests are about, we would have the same amount of fear about something else. Your fear would just be transported into a new vehicle. And, you know, we had this fresh new fear, a Croat, a virus. We don't have to talk about climate change for a while, but climate change will be back. It will be the most important thing in the world again. Someday soon as we get past this, Elissa, let's check to see how our prediction and suggestion records look. In the beginning of the Corona virus. Who told you that maybe we should move the restaurants outside into the streets from the summer? Probably be, and you see restaurants all over the country moving into the streets and outside. Who told you that there would be great to have outdoor movie theaters again? Probably. I'm the first person Who told you that? And there WalMart is transforming 160 of its parking lots into summer outdoor movie theaters. Yea, uh, who was, um, you know that I told you to close travel before a week before the president did from China. You know that? I told you the experts were lying to you about masks the first time I heard it. But here's the more. Um, remember I told you that hydroxy claure queen, whether it worked or not, was a good risk management decision that still looks like it's right. I would say this latest study and of Detroit, the one that's on the news and says It's that I drag folkloric queen. It works. I would say it's a little early for that. If you're relying on that study to say, Well, it's over now it looks like it works. That's too early. The odds of that study being debunked in the future probably over 75%. So whether hydroxy chlorate queen works or does not work, this latest study that says it works will almost certainly be devote. But that doesn't tell you whether it works about that's the world we're in. But in terms of a risk management decision, I think it already looks like it was strong because I doubt it's hurting anybody. Here's a question that was asked how many people died because the the news treated hydroxide clerk queen like poison because President Trump was promoting it. Think about that. You might actually be able to do the math and figure out how many people were killed by the illegitimate news business, right? You could actually do the math. Now you rest. It would be subject to lots of uncertainty, but let me put her number on it. If the If. It's true, this latest study is true that it cut the mortality rate in half. Uh, which would be a big claim. I'm not sure that that will stand up over time, but let's say you did. This is the way that news would report the story if the if this were reversed and President Trump is the only one who was saying don't use it and the mainstream media have been saying yes, using it's worth the risk. If this had been reversed, the story would be this. If the president had gone the other way, we might have saved 20,000 American lives, right? Because you know, over 100. What? 120,000 people have died in the United States from Corona Virus. If you could cut that in half, now, wouldn't get every person. Obviously, there's a supply problem and blah blah blah, so you wouldn't necessarily get to use the bed it medication on everybody. So it's not like you'd cut the entire death rate in half. But let's say it would have made a difference. We're talking about 20,000 people that were killed by the news. Think about it. Think about the fact that if the hydroxy claure Queen study holds up and again, I would say that's probably not gonna happen. But let's say that I drag simpler. Queen does turn out to be good and useful. That's all we'd be talking about. We wouldn't be talking about anything except how the president had killed 20,000 people with bad advice, but he's probably saved 20,000 people if they took it, and otherwise they might not have, whereas the news may have killed 20,000 people. But you will see that the news because the news. The news does not indict. The news says it is indeed little situation. The only thing better would be a doctor. Because if you're a doctor and you make a mistake, you could just bury it right. You know, it's like, Well, we'll just bury this mistake. But if you the news you can kill 20,000 people with intentional fake news and just don't report it, you just don't report it just like it did happen. That's convenient. Oh, so what else did I get right at the very beginning? What was one of the first things I told you? That's right. Vitamin D. Do you remember that? I told you at the very beginning, make sure you get some sun in vitamin D cause it's gonna make a difference. Now is a generic statement based on the fact that vitamin D is just generally good for you, your immune system. But did I know also before you heard it anywhere? Say, um, it looks to be that there's this weird correlation, which I just noticed in the wild. I was just looking at the situation and said, What is it about this group of people that are susceptible. So I started Googling because I had a hypothesis that it was that, um so I said to myself, first, African American people seem to be getting Corona virus worse. Google, African American vitamin D Yup, they get less of it. For obvious reasons, their skin color makes a little harder to absorb. So I think that's the reason I actually don't know if that's the reason, but it would be one of, um And then I said, Huh. What about the countries that are doing worse, that Google it? And what about people who have diabetes? I Google it, and basically the correlation really held. So today there's a report that there was a study that found out that vitamin D is very highly correlated with the death rate of Corona virus. Now that doesn't necessarily mean that if you boosted your vitamin D, you do better. But all common sense says yes. So, again, the correlation looks really strong based on this one study, which could be wrong tomorrow when there's another study. But, uh, looks like I was right about that, too. So if you're keeping score, if you have done everything that the idiot cartoonist told used to do about your health. You would be way ahead. Of what? The news Told you what the experts told you at all of your doctors. That's just a fact. Sorry. You know, I can't I'm not gonna tell you that I could do this the next time. There's a next time there's a crisis, it doesn't mean that I'm gonna be right every single time again. But it's starting to look like a pattern, doesn't it? If you had trusted me on most things, your you know, you wouldn't be right every time, Of course, But you'd be way ahead. Does anybody know what the net deaths are for this year? So one of the things I predicted, which I think I'm gonna be wrong about, but maybe not. No, I want to see the numbers. It doesn't seem to you that the number net deaths in the United States is being suppressed because you know that the protests are being suppressed, right? So the news is no longer showing the news. The news is becoming a decision maker. For what you can see, that's it sort of turned into that so we don't see the protests because, obviously they're trying toe reduce the impact of the protest. So the news is that so much reporting as making the news. They're creating the situation by actively trying to suppress the protests just by not covering. But likewise, it seems to me that the number of net deaths for this part of the year would be the most prominent thing you would see right. Don't you think you should be seeing just about every day on the news? If this were a normal year, here's how many deaths we would have on average this money per month. But because it was a Corona virus year, the number is 20,000 week higher than normal or something, or whatever the number is. Ask yourself why you don't see that number every day. Ask yourself why you don't see that number every day. It's because we were being manipulated. So whoever makes these decisions, I don't think it's like one person who is deciding the whole new cycle. But the people who decide what you see have decided that you shouldn't see that. Yes, I may be using the wrong term. Somebody in the comments is saying, Do excess deaths, not net deaths. That's probably the better term. So excess deaths meaning compared to the normal baseline. How many people die that you would not have expected in a normal year? And then you assume that most of them are Corona virus, but not necessarily. Yeah, So you do see number of deaths told total for Corona virus, but you don't see excess deaths every day. Is that because it's high or because is low? Ask yourself this. Why don't you know the most important question in the country or the world? Really, What's the most important question in the world? Our excess deaths, more or less that there would be no Israeli excess deaths at all? I guess you don't even know you don't even know it's the most important number in the world. Does anybody know? Of course it is. It's a gatherer herbal number, obviously. What's up with that? Every time you see something like that that's now reported, you have to ask yourself, Is that a decision? Did somebody say we don't want people to know this baby? Don't know. So Trump gave a speech last night. Probably. You heard, um, and the first thing I did was I tried to watch the speech without the benefit of any commentary. So I like to watch it and say to myself, All right, water, that one is his base. Got to think of it. And then I try to put myself in the other had to say, OK, what is what is the other team gonna think of this now? The other team is easy. You just say, Oh, they're gonna take stuff out of context and say it's dark in the evil racist, right, But cut easy. You didn't have to actually hear the speech to know what the criticism would be. Am I right? You did not need to hear the speech to write any of the criticisms that appeared today. Look at the criticisms. You tell me that you could not have written all of the criticisms before he gave the speech because they're sort of gin ear have to. Pundits have so far used the word dark. I wrote about this in the wind big league, and I talked about it in the 2016 cycle that there was a persuader who I speculated waas, rubber chill. Dini himself the greatest persuader or expert who wrote the book Influence and pre suasion so you would be considered kind of sort of the gold standard for influencers. And when everybody on the Democrat side in 2016 started using the word dark about Trump's speech at the convention, I said, There it is. That's the mark. That word dark does not come from normal political people. This looks like an outside adviser because that's that's a weapons grade persuasion that you just don't see from the regular political advisers. And it turns out that Jill Dini refused to, uh, he had no comment when asked if it was him. No, but nobody would no comment on that unless it was actually that. All right, Who in the world would if you said, did you give this specific piece of advice to the president? Who in the world would say no comment? You would only say that if he did. If you didn't you say now, that wasn't me, right? Because why would you? Unless you were just, like, the worst liar in the world or something? Um, all right, so we think that dark was probably given to the Democrats back in 2016. I've always seen it twice this year. Looks like they're trotting it out to see if it'll it'll work, but I don't know doesn't seem to have any purchase yet. So what I picked out was that Trump used the phrase bad evil people to talk about the ones who are causing trouble and taking them statues that were You're not even Confederate statues, etcetera. And I said, There it is. That's the quote that CNN will take into context. Uh, and sure enough, um, was that Marianne Marianne Williamson? So she was the 1st 1 to take it out of context on and say this. He is in her tweet, she said about the president's speech. He is positing all those who don't agree with him as evil people who are enemies of America. Nothing like that happened if you watched the speech, the president's words were extremely clear. We're all we're all Americans unifying, we're all Americans. And there were these. Some trouble makers were knocking down statues, and he's condemning them. The exact opposite of what Mary and Williams's says is that he's positing that all those who don't agree with them are evil people. not even close to anything like that happened in the speech. Nothing close to that. Literally the direct opposite of this. But if somebody didn't see the speech, what would they think if you hadn't seen the speech? You think? Well, you know, maybe maybe you said something like that. No, You said exactly the opposite of that. Um, here's what. So here's the other thing I was looking for. I was looking for whether the president hit a nerve. In other words, everything is a giant test of about this message. How about this statement about the way I frame this? Everything in the campaign is a continuous test to see if you got the right message that it hit a nerve. And sometimes you can't tell if you hit a nerve unless you see the reaction of the people you're trying to move. And let me let me read this reaction to you from Aaron Roop are who is a notable anti Trumper. So this is his comment about Trump's speech? He said Trump offers some remarkably overheated rhetoric. Interesting. All right, So the first thing you should note is that Roop are is calling the president's rhetoric overheated, All right, just hold that thought. And he said, uh, it is quoting the president. Um, saying the president said there is a new far left fascism that demands absolute allegiance. This left wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution. All right, So Rupe are is pointing out that this is overheated rhetoric. And if the things he wanted toe point out at for a criticism, he wanted to point out that this was going too far to say that the left was trying to demand absolute allegiance and that they were trying to overthrow the the American Revolution. Here's what I think. I think that hit a nerve. All right? You know, all this is very subjective, but I'm gonna tell you that based on all of my a lifetime of experience with persuasion, I think Erin Roop are is telling us directly. Please don't do more of this. That's what it feels like. It feels like it's true enough they earn group Are is trying to brush it back and say, I know this is bad. Uh, better Don't say that anymore. It feels like he knows that a nerve has been hit. Now Of course, there's a big difference between saying there's some trouble makers versus saying it sold the Democrats. They're all troublemakers. There's a difference. But if the Democrats air sort of supporting the team that are the small group of trouble makers, you can sell the argument pretty well. You can sell the argument that they're all the same on the left. As long as the left won't condemn them and does support them in other actions, would you say that the left does support the small group of people who were taking down statues and whatever do they support them? Do they even support the looters? Yeah, they dio they even support the looters by being very vocal about not wanting force being used, you know, toe being anti police. In the sense I think that Trump hit a nerve. Now, I'm gonna tell you some things that I don't think you did right in a moment. But on this one, because, remember, everything's in a B test. You're not trying to hit winners. You're not trying to get home runs every time you're trying to get that one that goes being ppb. This is the one. This is the one and I think Erin Rupert, who reads the room Well, in other words, he understands his you know, his side of things and isn't involved in politics. So I would say that his sensor is probably pretty well tuned. You know, that's not to say I agree with what he says. I'm just saying that he is sensitive to the situation. He can read the room, and I think he's afraid of this attack, cause I feel like you thinks it's too close. So did you notice that something seemed to happen in the last 48 hours when the president, basically I forget his exact term for black lives matter? But he basically said there was, ah, violent hate group or something. I think he's had a hate group. You saw that I tweeted that black lives. Matter is a, uh ah violent racist group. I got 10,000 retweets. I got 10,000 retweets from people. Not all of them. No, All of them were anonymous. Right? So Twitter isn't just anonymous people. I got 10,000 retweets calling black lives matter a violent racist group. Do you have any retweets I get on a normal Retweet. That does pretty well. 1000. It was about probably 5 to 10 times bigger response on something that you wouldn't expect people to even stick their head above the foxhole. Um, I mean, I thought I would have a good chance of getting canceled just for tweeting it right. It was controversial else that I thought I might might be the end of my career. The day I tweeted it, um, and 10,000 people re tweeted that. All right, so it is obvious now that this attack is hitting a nerve. I think that the left understands they went too far, and I think they know that they overshot the mark. And I think they know that their brand is now lawlessness and support for the complete destruction of the United States. Now is that over hated? You overheated rhetoric for me to say that the left wants the complete destruction of the United States. Well, actually not. That's the problem. The problem is, that is not overheated rhetoric because black lives matter and their supporters and anti five especially, they say directly they want to dismantle the entire system. You can tweak the patriarchy. It's not a tweak fix. It's a dismantle, and they use the words. Now if black lives matter, uses the words, dismantle the system and they have demonized way people quite directly as the racist and white supremacists and slave owners. Is it too far to say that they would seek retribution the moment that they felt safe in doing it and hunting down people like me? Did you see what happened? What I said in public that, uh, that Trump supporters might be hunted down and you could be dead in a year if if, uh if Biden wins, it wasn't because Biden and regular Democrats were gonna hunt down anybody. I'm not suggesting that you unordinary middle of the road Democrat is gonna look for revenge against Republicans. I think, No, no, all they have to do is give cover for the groups that well, which they're doing quite plainly right now. You don't have to wonder if most Democrats will give cover for the few Democrats were causing the trouble cause we're watching it. It's happening right in front of you. You don't have to wonder how that would play out. Of course they would. Would they do everything they could do to protect Trump voters in a Biden administration? No, no, There's no indication that they would lift a finger to protect anybody who wasn't their own team. There's nothing that would indicate that's the case. You've never heard one bit of rhetoric from the left that they would protect Trump voters. Have you? Have you ever heard one person left say, if I'm president were even just the way I think should think should be is that people should leave Trump voters load. Have you heard anybody saying anybody one time a celebrity politician in the House, Senate candidate for president? Have your anybody on the left or even in the news say, You know, people We should not demonize regular Trump voters. They just have a preference that's different from yours. Have you ever heard it? Not once. That is approval. There's no way that that could be interpreted anything but approval. So it's a silent approval, but approval in the last. So here's what I think happened the moment that the president and people like me, you know, less impact in my case, the moment that the president was willing to say in public directly the black lives. Matter is a hate organization, and we're not. We're gonna put him in jail for knocking down our statues. 10 year prison sentence for knocking out a guest, maybe a federal statute. Um, I think that the left realized they overplayed the hand. I don't think the left understood. The people on the right are legitimately afraid because they've said it directly. They want to dismantle the country. If you want to dismantle the country, you are saying I want to destroy everything. Now, normally, normally, in a situation like this, I would say No, no, no, They don't want to destroy everything. They just want a different system, you know, transition to something that works better. That's not what's happening. The loudest voices in the black lives matter don't want a transition anything. They just want to blow it up. There's no new plan. There's no plan. It tell me if you seem like has somebody drawn up the way the government will look without all the systemic racism? Have you seen that blueprint? There is that they only have. They only have a plan for destruction that's explicit. It's not an interpretation to prove me wrong, you just have to show me their plan for what it should look like when they're done. If you can show me the plan of what it looks like when they're done. Yeah, this is This is the world we're trying to build. It would look a little bit more like this if that exists. Well, then I'm certainly wrong, but it doesn't. It doesn't exist. And it won't exist because they're not. They're not in the building business there in the destruction business. Um, so here's what I think happened. I think that the Democrats realized they overplayed their hand and they're trying toe walk it back without looking like they're walking it back. Eso them? Or that any of you are willing to say that black lives matter is a violent racist organization with lots of people have good intentions. So what I talk about black lives matter. It's a very diverse group, which is the good news, right? The one good news about anything is that if you can get any diversity to agree on anything, uh, you know, maybe that's good. Unless you're leading a revolution that you don't understand, which would be bad. So lots of people within the movement or just well meaning people who got caught up in something they didn't quite know what they were getting into. How many people who are supporting and marching with black lives matter, understand that their entire way of life in the United States would surely be destroyed if black lives matter, got what he wanted? How many of the protesters understand that? Maybe not. Yeah, I said it before. This is the what? There's one group in the country, maybe the world that you can criticize, and nobody can fault you for it. You can't make fun of people for their appearance or ethnicity. Gender, and I don't suggest that you do. Yeah, I'm I'm happy that those things were largely off the table, but there's one group that we can all mock mercilessly, and I hope you'll join me in it. It's young people, and the reason you can mock young people is because either you are one. I mean, they're only two conditions. If you're alive, you either are a young person. Oh, are you used to be one. So you do have a right to mock young people because it's you. You used to be. Well, you know how smart you were when you were 20. You know how smart you were when you're 40 if you're 40 or over and it's not very close, it might. It might feel like it's should be close with your 20. What? You're 20. You're pretty sure you've got the context now you're like, I'm a smart as I'll ever be like you wise, which might actually be true But you don't know very much about context and framing and how much you've been manipulated and how you've been brainwashed your entire life. But it might take another 10 years to figure it out. So we have a revolution that's being led by And I say this with love, our dumbest citizens on average, dumbest meaning young. All right, there's no ethnicity. And what I'm saying, I'm only talking about Young is always less informed than Mawr. Experience is just a fact of life. So here we have a group of people who are leading this thing. They went way too far. They have convinced the people on the right that they mean it. Let me ask you this. Do you think there any people on the right who were preparing to leave the country because they think it's all gonna that society itself will be ripped apart. Yes, there are people on the right who are smart and they're not crazy. People whatsoever were planning to leave the country because they think that the left will actually become a violent mob. But that will destroy whatever is here, and there's nothing that can stop it now. I don't think that's the case. I'm not in that camp. But the left has gone so far that people are considering moving the moving out of the country. And I'm not talking about the people who said If Donald Trump is elected, I'll move to Canada. None of that was serious. I'm talking about people who are actually making plans to get their self the fuck out of this country because the black lives matter. People and the protesters and Antifa appear to be unstoppable if nobody is willing to stop them and there doesn't seem to be a willingness to stop them now. I don't do that. I think things will far more likely just revert to something close to normal in a few months in my opinion that the only reason any of this is happening is a weird coincidence. And the weird coincidence is that Corona virus made it necessary to wear masks at the same time that people wanted to protest. And wouldn't it be convenient if you could wear a mask? All right. So if we did not have this weird mask coincidence, which is the weirdest coincidence, you have to wear a mask. And by the way, it might be pro testing. Wouldn't that be convenient? So So it is by its nature, something that would not be alone term problem if we can contain it, which I think we will, Which is why the news is now actively managing that the protests to decrease them. Let me ask you this. If the people who ran the mainstream news which of course is corrupt and nothing like news anymore, it's just fake news. It's just straight up propaganda. If the propaganda is who do what, what looks like news. If they thought that the showing the protests, we're good for their side. Wouldn't you see a lot more of it? Have you noticed that they stopped coverage of the protests and doesn't your common sense say, if these protests were bad for Trump, I think we'd see a lot more of them. Just a lot more footage and stuff. So you're definitely being manipulated by the news? All right, if you didn't know that here is a really good, uh, mind spinner. Um, so, uh, G. Lane Maxwell, the co conspirator with Epstein a Z you know, got picked up. And Alan Dershowitz wrote a fascinating article about that situation. Now, of course, he used the situation to defend himself against allegations that he was with some young woman. And if you've ever seen one of the top lawyers of all time defend himself, it's really worth looking at. It's worth looking at just to see how well he makes his argument. It's just every time I read Dershowitz, I just go Wow, that was really well done. Even if even if you don't like his point of view, you end up going, okay, that's really skilful. And he did it again. So he writes this article in which he is noting that a lot of the people who have testified the young women who have these horrific stories of things that happened with Epstein and on the island. Dershowitz very persuasively points out that they have been, um would you say, discovered to be liars at the highest level? In other words, we know they made up stories about other people being on the island because you can check the record and you can know for sure that they weren't there when these witnesses were claiming it was all happening. So Dershowitz's explanation of the witnesses being completely unreliable I mean, as unreliable as anything could be, let me tell you how unreliable would be. Imagine if you had a person who, uh, claimed he saw murder on his front lawn. Well, the first time it happened, you'd say, Well, we don't see any signs of a murder, but we're going to treat this seriously because you reported a murder. And then in the end, they say, All right, it looks like nobody got murdered on your lawn. And then you call the police the next week, you say another person got murdered on my lawn. Well, maybe you take you seriously. You say that sounds a little familiar, but we'll check it out and again. Nobody got murdered on the lawn play back the video. It's obvious there was nothing happening on the law. The third time you call and say, Somebody just got murdered on my front lawn. What do the police say? They say, Well, maybe working out yourself, right? So if you've been caught in an exact lie of the type that is on the table, that is the lowest level of credibility you can have. You're not just somebody who in some general way is undependable. You're someone who is specifically undependable on this exact question, and it's been proven. That's the lowest level of credibility you could actually have. You can't get lower. You lie on this exact question, and we know it. It's proven so. Dershowitz makes the case that the witnesses that sound when you see them out of context. And by the way, I watched. I watched the Epstein movie on Netflix, which through Dershowitz under the bus pretty hard with, you know, allegations against him in that film, and Dershowitz tells the story of giving them all of the background information that was exculpatory some of the same stuff he mentions in the article. He gave it to Netflix, a complete defense that my opinion is actually really strong. I mean, really strong. I wasn't there. I don't know what happened. I'll never know what happened, but I'm just looking at the defense. Based on real facts that could be checked. Fax. You could check yourself. He gave that to Netflix, and they didn't put it in the film. They didn't put it in the film. Think about that. They threw Alan Dershowitz under the boss, accused him of being a sex criminal. And the the accusers have a record, according to Dershowitz, of being liars on this exact thing, accusing other people that we know for sure words there. How do you not include that? How do you not include that? Really? What kind of world are you living in? Where the exculpatory information, they just ignore like it wasn't there. So the level of evil that requires is just mind boggling. Uh, the way I don't think that Glyn Maxwell is innocent by any means. But when you you see dear, she would set it up. Say, Well, you basically his argument assessed that he's not saying anything about Maxwell because he doesn't know. So you're saying I don't know anything that she did. I didn't observe anything wrong. But here's the context. All of the accusers have been proven liars on these very accusations. I mean, this type of accusation, not the specific ones against her. That's a really strong argument. You know, There's no I can't even imagine a jury that could convict on that unless you less video appears or something later. All right, So don't be surprised. Uh, don't be surprised if Delaine Maxwell does not get convicted of anything. And the other possibility is apparently there was some kind of a plea deal when Epstein originally went, went to jail and one of those times, there's some kind of an existing plea deal that might give Maxwell immunity, but it's sort of untested. She might have immunity. There might be she might not going to jail at all. I think about that. All right, here's the worst idea I've ever heard in my entire life. They're gonna play the black national anthem before the NFL games on, then do the regular national anthem. Um, prior Now, of course, one understands why they're doing it. They're trying to do the best they can tow satisfied not only their players, but there fans. And it's just a tough situation, all right, so I feel bad for the NFL because there's just no way to win. They just don't have. Ah, they just don't have a winning play. But I think they found the worst solution, because how do you feel if you are, let's say, a football watcher and you see an alternate national anthem, the alternate national anthem. Now they're referring to it as a black national anthem. But let's take the blackout. You just heard there's a an alternative national anthem for a subset of America. How does that make you feel? Does it make you feel like an American? Now that there's two national anthems, it doesn't matter if it's a black national anthem. Could be the woman National Anthem could be the LGBT Q national anthem. It doesn't matter what subset of Americans were talking about. Uh, this might be one of the worst ideas I've ever seen from a business. I feel like the NFL is gonna have the lowest, um, ratings they'll ever have. Unless people are so starved for entertainment that they watch anyway. I guess it's a wild card because people are starved for entertainment. So maybe it will be the highest ratings ever had, But they might. People might tune in 10 minutes after the game starts. Did not watch it. Now, what's my personal feeling about? It is I don't get worked up about, you know, symbols. I don't care about flags and flag burnings. I don't care about national anthems. I don't care about kneeling, and I don't care about statues too much. Um, just generally speaking, if you're talking about symbolism, just working out, working out among yourselves if if there are Americans who care deeply about these symbols and they want toe, mix it up with, you know, verbally mix it up with other people, have a different opinion, I just I'm just gonna watch the show wherever it comes out. Statues? Yes. Statues. No, I'm gonna be fine with it. Either way, I just can't get invested in something so ridiculous. So, personally, I'm not invested in any of it. I don't think football's important. I don't think you should be played by the way. I think football should be banned, you know, because they had injuries, especially for Children. Maybe for adults. You let them take the chance. But certainly I would ban football for Children. That's another another story. So I think the NFL is shooting themselves in the foot with this, but we'll say it could turn out to be brilliant. We'll see. Um, here's something that's but worrisome trend. Self self defense is starting to look illegal now. Did you know that? Didn't you have a pretty good idea in your head? What self defense looked like? And you thought you knew what it waas? It's starting to you, murky. And I'm worried that the the realm of what we would call self defense is shrinking so that the angry mobs can get at you a little bit better. Let me give you an example. Eso Apparently, I don't have an update on this, but the last I knew, the McCloskey is the couple who were the gun wielding a couple in their big house that they protected against the crowd. Apparently, there is still being considered for charges. Are you kidding me? They're still being considered for maybe being charged with a crime for simply having guns to to at least have some defense against this crowd. No, I don't know if it was because the wife pointed her gun. Does that make a difference under lawyer, and maybe it varies by state. But where exactly was the crime? That was as self defense see as anything I've ever seen in my life? There were lawyers, for God's sakes. They knew what a crime is. Their lawyers. They know what a crime is. They weren't trying to commit a crime, that's for sure. Uh and then I heard another one today about there's a question about what police should do or really what anybody should do. Let's say the mob surround your car. If the mob surrounds your car, they start breaking the windows and there's even somebody with a gun and, you know, they shot somebody in a car. So it's like the worst, scariest situation. But the mob is all around your car. What can you do in self defense? Can you drive forward at the risk of hitting people when you know you would hit people? Can you drive slowly? Can you give them like warnings and, like, you know, sharp little moves forward to get him out of the way? But if he has somebody, you're still liable and you go to jail. Even the question of your car surrounded by people, you're not allowed to just drive through them even if they're attacking your car. And the fact that that's even a question. Are you kidding me? That's a question. Let me let me say if somebody attacked somebody surrounds my car, I'm going to drive forward. If there's somebody in front of my car, they will be. They will be killed or injured, but I'm gonna do it. I'm not going to sit there with a crowd that's beating on my car and threatening May. I'm gonna drive forward and I'm gonna take out anybody who's in front of me, and I'm not gonna even think twice about it. I'm not even gonna feel guilty about it. I'm gonna look in my rear view mirror and see brains spilled on that on the on the road behind me. I'm not gonna have a nightmare about that. I'm not even gonna have PTSD about that, All right, That's that's just May. But let me let me say it again. If you put me on a jury in this country, I am not going to convict anybody for what looks like self defense. Moreover, if it's a gray area, they're not gonna be convicted by May. Put me on a jury. If it even looks a little bit self defense, he in the context of these big crowds, I'm not talking about a normal crime, right? A normal crime. You have to look at each one individually. But in the context of these protests, if somebody does something that's even arguably a little bit self defensive, they're good with may good with May, because here's what I don't expect of my fellow citizens. I don't expect you to be speed lawyers in an emergency. You're probably not a lawyer. And if you were, you don't have much time to think. I'm not going to ask you to be a legal scholar while the crowd is ascending on you. If the crowd descends on you, this is Scotts rule. Let me put it out there. Are you ready? This is Scots law, just making this up now. Scots Law says that the crowd comes after you. There is nothing you can do to defend yourself. Got it? There's nothing you can't do to defend yourself if a crowd threatens you that Scots law put me on the jury. Yeah, let's say the crowd comes in and they're chanting things and they surround you and you pull out a machine gun. And you, you you killed 27 people. Self defense, self defense. That's just may. You can do anything you want. It's a free country, so far little less free than it used to be. But if it's May, you could take out a machine gun and you could take care of the entire crowd that's threatening you. And you could even finish off the people who are on the ground suffering. And I would still still say, Looks like self defense to me. I know because you don't know if those people in the ground we're gonna get up right? I mean, you're not some expert on military or defense. If a civilian get surrounded, that's just may. I don't recommend that you do that because taking self defense recommendations for me would be a certain way to get you killed, just telling you my attitude. So I think we've reached the point where the slippery slope has met the wall, slippery slope, meet wall. Uh, I'm were all able to say now that black lives matter is a violent racist organization. Now, by the way, that's not an opinion that's actually black lives matters. Self branding. You saw a hawk Newsome, head of the black lives. He's a leader in Black lives matter New York, which is obviously an important, important branch of black lives. Better. And he said on television, I think you said it more than once recently, that they do not askew violence, that you know that they will be peaceful if they can get what they want. But if they can't get through, piece of violence is on the table. And you said you said it directly. I'm not interpreting. I'm not like reading between the lines. You said it directly and guess what? I agree with him. The reason The reason I know I'm not misinterpreting it is because it's a perfectly reasonable statement, which is. And here's the second part, as what points out that if you look at the history of this country, almost nothing ever changes without violence, and it's a really smart thing to say, because it's true. This is one of those countries. And maybe it's just too everywhere that until there's at least the threat of violence, things don't really change, you know, because you don't have to. You can say, Well, deal with that tomorrow, then don't So he's not wrong that if they need, you know, if they feel that they're willing to do whatever it takes to get these changes, whatever they might be that violence is on the table. So if your organization leader says violence is on the table, you are a violent organization, and you can see your individual members who were being violent. Secondly, is it racist? Off course this, of course. This. It's totally racist. Let me make it analogy for you is, uh is black lives matter you equally concerned with other lives? Obviously not. The whole point of black lives matter is that it's a preference, you know, they're not looking for equality. They're looking for, at least the way the slogan is presented. I'm not mind reading anybody's individual thoughts. I'm saying that the way the the way it's presented is that their problems are special because they came from a certain a certain historical path, I would argue that saying that black people's problems are special, whereas, let's say, some Hispanic American Filipino American who was born into poverty. I guess their problems are special, that they don't get any help because they don't have the right kind of skin. It's just purely racist, is violent and his racist. Now again, I think, by and large, most of the members most of the protesters have something like good intentions. But they have joined onto a violent, racist organization. Well, they are realizing. Speaking of that, let's talk about the president's speech, which is being called racist and divisive. Those have you watched the speech last night? Give me your opinions will take. There's a little time, like in the comments, but your opinion Was the president's speech unifying? Or was it racist and divisive? Go. What is your opinions? And then I'll tell you about it. By the way, I do plan to have surgery someday. If the crew of the virus doesn't keep delaying it, I'll get my Sinuses fixed on. All right, so I'm looking at you, or comments coming in, I guess. Gonna take a little offer them to here. Here's where I think if the president wanted to be a unifying, it wouldn't have sounded anything like that. So I don't think it was a unifying speech, Uh, or even close to anything like that. Did anybody think that was unifying? So, uh, he decided not to tell jokes. And the plate is seriously, They talked about America and he talked about, you know, we're all Americans, etcetera. So there were definitely things he said that you could You could identify as attempts that unification. But here's the thing. And if the president So I'm looking okay, Comments are coming in now. Good, Good. Somebody says dark. Somebody says Best truth. Somebody said low energy. I will agree with low energy. It looked low energy to the point where he looked really tired, actually, Uh, some people saying It's very unifying, patriotic. Somebody said to mild, which is not divisive enough, I guess. Uplifting and unifying, Unifying, unifying, unifying. All right, here's what you all got wrong. Unfortunately, all of those although all of those of you who are saying that it was unifying um I hate to break it to you. I got I hate to break it to you. That might be the least unifying speech I've ever seen in my whole fucking life. Let me tell you why. If this isn't obvious to you, you really haven't been listening to the protesters. You know, if you have this many protests, if this many people are protesting, at the very least, you wouldn't listen to him. You don't have to agree. You don't have to agree, but I'm starting to think you haven't even listen to them because here's here's why. This was the least unifying speech of all time. That's saying too much. It wasn't unifying. Here's why the president talked about all of us appreciating our great history and our and our shared heritage. How does that sound to you? Let's say, Let's say, for example, you're watching this periscope. There's as statistical chance that you might be white and a Trump supporter. How Abaza sound to your ear when you hear you'd like to everybody to share and honor are our heroes and our shared cultural, you know, history. How's it? Does it feel unifying right? You're like, Yeah, our shared history were Americans. Let's revel in our shared history. Okay, here's what's wrong with that. Ah, lot of the history Was people being slaved? How in the world are black Americans supposed to look at the history of the United States and say, Yeah, that looks good. Let me buy into that shared heritage. Where are you my great great great whatever was a slave? How in the world does that is that unifying in the context of protests with black lives matter. You know, the statues coming down, the legacy of slavery, that the room is about slavery. Slavery is like the biggest topic in the news right now. It's on the top of minds, and the president said, Let's celebrate our shared history well this year. History is some people doing well and some people slaves how in the world of the slaves, the other people who descended from slaves or have any connection to it, How in the world are they supposed to hear that speech? And here it was like heritage and culture and saying, Yeah, let's let's honor some of that stuff where my people were slaves, or let's honor that part where the Native Americans were slaughtered to get their land. How in the world is that unifying? I would say that that speech was an attempt to be not unifying. In my opinion, in my opinion, it was written with the intention of being a more for the base that did the base like it? Yeah, they did. So I, uh I was wondering how the base was responding, and they're responding very well because the base has a gigantic blind spot. You know, you dio not every single person, obviously, but the base has a gigantic blind spot, which is history is not so kind to a lot of people who live in this country and should be You should feel good about it, just the way you feel good about it if you dio So, uh, I would say that a unifying speech would have directly referenced that and would have directly acknowledged that, and and some something would have looked more like, um, yeah, let's let's appreciate more lovable. Now here's what Here's what I like that he did. He didn't mention the heroes of our history, and he quite pointedly mixed in ah, lot of African American heroes with the other heroes. But did that make everybody happy? No, because there was no LGBT Q in that list. I don't even know if there was a woman in the list. Was there there might have been one. Was your baby one woman in the list of American heroes? So you can't really satisfy people with Hey, we'll throw in some statues for you guys to, you know, to show that everybody's everybody's equal will give you some statues because the group that didn't get a statues is going to say, uh, it's great that white people and black people have statues. But how about me? So there's no winning. So did the president take the most politically advantageous approach, which is pushing back on the statue? People, which is based, wanted using words like culture and heritage, which sounds racist to half the country but to his base, just sounds like common sense. Um, then you generally genuinely don't hear it. I think it is. It is legitimately true that people on the right just don't hear that they don't Here it is racist, but it's because you haven't lived anybody else's life. Um, everybody else says the same problems. That is not a problem on the right. It's problem that nobody really knows what anybody else is feeling or thinking. All right, So my opinion is that the speech might have been good for his base, which was important. So maybe it was politically correct in terms of unifying, I would say used the words that you know won't unify. So if you intentionally put into a written speech words that are guaranteed to not unify you can't really say it was an attempt. It wasn't really an attempt to unify. Oh, so somebody saying that there were some women in his list, several of them. Ella Fitzgerald, Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman. Thank you. Clara Barton. Oh, thank you. Okay. So when I was hearing the list, I was not taking note of them. Dolly Madison. Was she on the list? All right. Somebody says statues are idols used for mind control. I agree with that. Statues are a form of mind to control, just as the history of the country is just as the pledge of Allegiance, just as the flag is. So all of our symbols are they have utility. We use symbols because they do something. They have a function. It's a tool. It programs people to think a certain way. That's why we do it? Eso The president suggested building a special garden in which statues would be, but he didn't say if we would be moving statues and he didn't say, Are we building some extra statues to those other people you mentioned? So there's some questions to be answered, but that wasn't a bad idea. I think on the right, people were pretty happy with the idea of putting them in a special place where you've got better context. Yeah, so I would say the president did a good job from the perspective of his base. He did nothing to, uh, to make the left move toward him. But maybe that doesn't matter, because maybe you can't. Maybe you can't move the other side toward you, so maybe it doesn't matter. But yours. Here's the take away. I believe the Left is afraid of the president's framing of them as dangerous, basically dangerous racist hate groups. So that does seem to be the most productive attack, the one they worry about the most. And there's plenty of evidence to make that case, so it's very dangerous, right? Um, everything is a form of mind control, somebody says with a smiley face. That's true. Everything does impact the way you think your environment doesn't. All right, um, professors or indoctrinating kids with my in control? Yeah, I think so. I think that's a fair thing to say. Um, did you see I tweeted this around that there that I mentioned this there actually is a national effort to build a national bike paths around the country so that you could bicycle from one side of the country to the other and would be a touristy thing to do. So that's actually underway. I tweeted that the other day. Amazing. All right. Somebody says dumbest idea I've ever heard. I don't know if you're talking about the garden full of statues or not. All right, that's all we got. I will talk to you tomorrow. Haven't grated Fourth of July.
