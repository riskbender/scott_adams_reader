pump up. Hey, everybody, come on in. Well, maybe 44. Cave B 44. It's your first periscope. Aren't you lucky? Imagine your first periscope being this one. It's like you won the lottery. Good to see you all. Uh oh. My regulars. And before we get going, what do we need? You know what we need. We need the simultaneous happened. All you need for that is a couple of bugger glass attacker Chelsea's time the canteen drinking flask of vessel levity kind. Fill it with your favorite liquid. I like coffee and join me down for the unparalleled pleasure. The dopamine, the end of the day. The thing that makes everything better, including the pandemic. Racism with the economy, you name it. It's called the simultaneous stepping That happens now. Go. Mm. All key indicators improving. So a number of people have contacted me in variety of ways to say that my evening periscopes had been very beneficial to them during the pandemic. And I appreciate that. And I wish I could keep doing that all the time. But having a morning thing and an evening thing seven days a week is really hard. I don't know I don't know if you realize how hard it is to do to live streams today, but here's my suggestion. I'm trying to get married, uh, one of these days soon so we get all the details workout. Everything's are including a virus times, but I won't be able to add that to my schedule anytime soon. However, I would give you this advice. Have you experimented with turning off the news for a day as any and not watching your twitter for day? Does anybody Is anybody done that just as experiment? I've done that. And it is amazing how different you feel because the news and social media is literally designed to make you get all wound up, and it does it really well, does it so well. And if you just turn it off and what I find is, if I could turn it off like 5 p.m. I still have all the knowledge I need, but I don't get all the extra, you know, worry and you just go outside, for example, during the worst of the pandemic and the economy is falling apart and there's protests. And if I look at my screens, the whole world is falling apart. Everything I pick up, it's like I pick up my phone. The world is falling apart, turned on the TV. I, uh, look a Twitter. The world is falling apart. And then I would just go for a walk. Walk outside that look around. I think there's really nothing different for most of us for a lot of people. Great disruption. Of course, we're not minimizing that. But for the great majority of us, things were kind of normal in our little individual lives. Changed that much, and I'm not sure if any of that other stuff that's you brewing around the country will make that much difference. So here's some perspective. The Corona virus is not going to stop killing people anytime soon, but the number of people who kills is now so small relative to the population of Earth that it doesn't really warrant the same kind of worry it used to. Now you should still do the minimum of you medically advisable behavior, but it doesn't look like it's going to be the killer that changes the world, you know, in some permanent way. It's pretty obvious now that we'll get through it. So if you have any questions, you know, will we get through it? I think that's answered. The answer is yeah, we will. Wilson. Hospitals have impact. Probably. Will people die who shouldn't have died if we've done things differently? Yes, but that's a decision that we've made, and I don't think it hurts. They Independence Day fell worded. Do you think about Have you thought about the, uh, the psychological importance, At least in the United States? The fact that Independence Day literally Independence Day fell exactly where it did in in terms of our thinking about being shut down the Corona virus and all that. And I think you saw the outcome. At least young people just said, Well, I'm done. I think the young people just said, I don't believe your science. Probably I should have gone to work the whole time because I'm young. My risk was low. People just said, Well, how about independence now? I don't know if that's the right decision of the wrong decision, but it doesn't matter. It actually doesn't matter. Yes, if people going out and exposing themselves is right or wrong, because it's gonna happen, you know, if there was some choice about maybe people will go back to the Basques and, you know, full protection. But I don't think there's a GS of that. I think it is what it isn. Let's just deal with what it is, which is a lot of people will die, but not a lot of people compared to all the people in the world. And we live in a risky world. So of course, if I'm the one who dies, don't feel pretty bad about it. But nonetheless, the humans have chosen freedom over safety. We have explicitly chosen freedom over safety at least freedom over complete safety, complete safety. All right, so just turn off the news. You'll feel fine. Believe me, it works really well. Also, make sure that you get exercise every day. Have you experimented with this yet with the When the pandemic was got kicked off, first was getting kicked off. One of things I told you is to get exercise everyday. Go for a walk At least you do something every day and I've experimented. What happens? What? I don't if I do, you know if something happens, if events overtake me and I cant exercise on the day that I plan to And then I test that I consciously say, OK, today I did not exercise. How do I feel tonight? You could really tell You can really tell, um I don't sleep well. My boot isn't the same. It's completely different. So if you're feeling that your mood is not good and you didn't exercise today, well, you have something to try That probably hasn't 85% chance of improving your mood. Um, I have loving seeing the Condi a panic that is being caused on left because people assume that if Kanye Ran is some kind of 1/3 party or independent, he would take more votes from the left than the right and guarantee trump the victory. So it is funny to watch their, uh they're, um if they're panic of that and at the same time, they don't want to go too hard at Konya, But they kind of don't want him in there. And I love the fact that we don't know yet if he's serious, you know how serious is Copy a at or and even more to the point, does he need to be serious? Because Katia could just put the thought out there and see what happens and maybe decide to be serious if other people are serious, Here's what I've expected. I think the next presidential poll has to include him, doesn't it? Do you think Rasmussen could do a poll without adding can be a to it. I think they'll have to do it both ways for a while. But what do you like to see? A day one? How many votes Qadi would get in a three way race? Would you like to see that? I like to see it because I think it puts Trump solidly on top. So essentially, Kanye is the only one who would get to decide who is president. Well, let me say that again. We live in a Democratic republic. In theory, everybody's got what vote. But you know, we get a representatives and the representatives try to represent us. Is representatives as well as possible. That's the system we think we're in, right? That's the system you think you read. But it's down to one person. If Kanye runs, Trump is president again. If he doesn't run according to the polls, is Biden the entire Democratic system came down to one guy and all he had to do was tweet Cardy West Row One tweet. It took over the country, meaning that he gets to pick the president. If you think you get to pick the president well, you're all like you don't Onley. Kanye gets to pick the president. If he bows out. Probably Biden. If you stay. Is that probably drunk? It's just out of the one person. Now, could everything be more absurd at the guest? Funnier. What is the biggest issue with the news? That's not the pandemic. The biggest issue in the news is that we live in, uh, uh, white supremacist society. That's right. We live in a white supremacist society in which the only person who gets to decide who our president is is Qadi a West. I'm not making this up, you know that What I just said is absolutely true. I mean, statistically, anything could happen, right? But as a basic fact, Cartier West is the only person who gets a vote this fucking year. I'm not even know that. Happy about it, are you? I'm not sure that's a worse system. If you said to be Scott. There are two potential systems, one in which the voters can be massively mis informed by the press. And then they'll take their massive misinformation to the polls and then the vote in what will be largely Iran by his process, because nobody had good information. And then we'll add Russian interference and Chinese interference and vote rigging, and we'll get some kind of a completely non incredible result. The half of the country thinks they have to have a revolution in order to overthrow it. That's our current system. The current system is what I just described a completely non incredible system in which people are brainwashed from the wrong information. Don't believe they are vote anyway, and you get some completely random ridiculous results. Compare that system to let's let the county a figure it out. Let Kanye decide. Can you honestly tell, May you get a better result from the current system? That's saying, How about we just try, like like, can you figure it out? I don't know which one's better if you say you know which one of those two systems gives you a better outcome. I think you're lying. I think you're lying. You don't know that now. What would be a bad system is to give one person complete power right when you have a dictator, blah, blah, blah center. But if it just sort of happened, it just sort of accidentally happened that the only person who gets to make a decision is copy A. I don't know. That might be OK. Let me blow your bloody for a while. All right? Here's the most mind blowing thought you've ever had. Well, I guess I oversold it. Take that down to It's one of many mind blowing thoughts that you buy have over the course of your year. It goes like this. If Kanye is serious, let's say stays of the race. Here's my claim. He will be the first president we ever had that you would doubt his boat. Itv's right. Think about it. We've never had a president where you didn't doubt their motives the entire time. Now you might not doubt their boat is sort of in general, but rather you doubt the mud specific decisions like, well, that feels a little friendly to the big military industrial complex, Or is that a little bit racist? I can tell. Or did you just do that? Because your base needs to hear it. But you know it's not true. Think about it. We've never had any kind of president who, at least the other team said, I think they really mean what they're saying. We've never had that. He would be the first president who, when he said something, it could be brilliant. It could be not brilliant. But the one thing you wouldn't doubt is did he meet it? Is it Is it exactly what he was thinking? Yeah. Yeah. It would be the first time you ever had a president. Who? You wouldn't wonder if he was trying to do the right thing. You wouldn't even wonder. He would definitely be trying to do the right thing. Why? Why the hell did you do it otherwise, right? You know, it wouldn't make any sense. So what would be in the Kanye is best interest. Like even if you said Are you, Scott, you're being a little too too generous here. Everybody's selfish. So candy is a person. He's a human being. So of course, we'll have some selfish motives to To which I ask you what What would they be to make money? No, To improve his reputation. Politics isn't going to do that. To what feed his ego. Katia is exactly who is who you see, right? He has it. He has a big ego, which he earned by doing big things. I don't. Is that a problem? Doesn't look like a problem. So anyway, you'd be interesting. And, uh, if I had to guess, I'd say I was 50 50 whether he's serious about this thing and I'm not sure he's decided yet, so we'll find out. Here's a way to know if you are in a bubble. Um, I started the other day to make a list of people I thought were independent thinkers, and it was a pretty short list, people who you could depend on to look at the information and just come up with an independent opinion. That is not the same as what the media is assigning people. There's only maybe I can think of maybe 20 people. You know, some of them are obvious, right? You could pretty much depend on bite sort of inch to have an opinion. That's a well thought out opinion that doesn't match anybody else's. They did a better thought. You could expect that of, uh, you know, maybe a Joe Rogan or Eric Weinstein. You can expect it of. Yeah. You think a dozen people, Michael Malice Matt Taibi Tucker is a little. I think the people work on TV news, have a little bit of a constraint on what they could Dio so. But Tucker would be a freethinker within that environment yet Yeah, live. All would be an obvious one that Gates says. Surprisingly, for someone who is a professional politician back, Gates does seem to be able to take opinions that don't match up with his parties average. So I would say that uh, yes. All right. So, uh, yeah, so you see a number of other dames there. So here's how to tell if you're one of those independent thinkers or if your opinions have been assigned to you. Think about who your favorite news sources. It could be the network, or it could be an individual. So you could say you might be saying, Oh, it's Tucker or it's I don't know, 11 whoever it is, but think about who your favorite news sources and that ask yourself Which of your opinions disagree with that source? If the answer is none. Yes. Uh, Glenn Greenwald is another one. Bill Maher is another one. Uh, got felled. Is another one. Greg Gutfeld. Yeah, Yeah, it's What's funny is that you all come up with the same names. Like I didn't have to see that list. The list would look the same. Uh, if you would just made it yourself, rand. Paul, Uh, I like. Yeah, OK, I'll say Rand. Paul. Yeah, I think we could. Added to the list as a independent thinker. It's hard if your job is Senator. You know, there's a limit to how much independence you can have is a senator, you doubt you definitely have to be in the team, but he's more independent than other people. Yes. All right. So ask yourself that question. And in the comments, tell me in the comments. If you just did that exercise you had, did you just discover that your that your opinions are exactly the ones that are being assigned to you? Yeah. You love bus would be another one. Yep. Um, so let's give an update on the statue. Chess. So the president weighed in about this Frederick Douglass statue of Use, an abolitionist was ripped from its base in Rochester, New York, and dumped over offenses of the nobody saw it done. Now do you think if somebody took down an abolitionist statue and there's no video of it happening and nobody took credit? Does that sound like the protesters did that or doesn't sound like a revenge? I'm pretty sure that's a revenge statue situation that just sounds like somebody on the other side who said, Well, you know, if we're playing chess with statues, I'm gonna take one of your pieces Now, I watched this with amusement because I'm not very invested in statues. So let me explain that if you make a statue and somebody rips it down, I can see why you would be bad. I could see baby why the other person would be bad at whatever your statue stood for, but I don't really care. I want, I suppose. I guess I want to care just cause this is the news. But I can't think of anything less important. Think about the fact that you know, let's say your parents and Drapers I grew up with problems like World War Two. Now that's a problem. How about, uh, you know about, you know, women can't vote? That's a problem. How about slavery? That's a problem. How about the Great Depression? That's a problem. These are big problems. Fast forward to today. Hey, somebody ruined a statue that my team likes well will ruin your statue. That's it. Have we become such ridiculous weiners that we think the world is ending because we're having a chess game with statues? Do you know how many statues I care about? None. There's not a single statue I care about. Well, I'll make an exception for, let's say, the Lincoln body bid. You know, the ones there that are actually so famous, you know, the Mount Rushmore. You know those air? Those are special cases, but just a statue, a statue in a park that I never heard off. If you're getting worked up over statues, I think you're missing the bigger picture. That if all that's happening is our statues air coming down, it doesn't feel like a big problem. Now I understand the argument. Let me make the argument for you. It's part of a larger Marxist plan to first remove. There are symbolism to carve away and our national identity carve away at the psychology of patriotism until it's a softened up environment to make their big push to turn this into a Marxist country. Maybe, Maybe I don't know how many of the protesters have that thought process. And let me ask you this. If we had something like a news organization, would you not see on the news? What are these Marxists being interviewed now? They might lie and say, Oh, no, that's not our plan. We just don't like these statues. But shouldn't you have somebody out there that you at least believe, has that view so they could be interviewed? Let me ask you this. If you believe that the whole statue thing is part of the larger Marxist Revolution, ask yourself why the news that you watch doesn't have any representative of that opinion of their show. I gotta take this opinion until, until facts change, right, so I'll give you a temporary pin. It goes like this. If you don't see an interview of somebody who has that opinion on any that work, there's no network that has somebody on say, okay. You know what you really want to do is introduced Marxism. Can you explain that? You tell us why you want that, etcetera? Where is that person? Really? You can't find one person. You should assume this is not true or that your news, Your news business is no longer in the news business that they don't want to show it to you. Because if it were true, at least Fox News would be interviewing that person, right? At the very least, you'd see the right leading publications have sit down interviews with somebody who just tries to tell you why you know their view of the future of the country is the right one. You don't see that, which makes me believe that the whole Marxist story is just complete hallucination. Now, what would it take to change my mind? Here's a good question. You should ask yourself all the time, But ask yourself this. This is my opinion. Whatever the topic, what would it take to change my body? Here's what it would take for them. It would take an interview with somebody who represents that opinion, and I could be convinced that they represent other people's opinion because they say they're part of a larger group. Now, if you say you've seen it, it's clearly that something that's well represented they don't label them. Looks like Scott needs to find that interview himself, simply says, I don't think the person exists. Likewise, when it was last time, you saw a white supremacist interviewed anywhere. The reason this because they sort of don't exist. They're now, of course, the word white supremacists is now morphed into a whole different meeting, but in terms of the old Thai, but people who thought that everybody in their group was superior to everybody in some other group that just doesn't exist anymore because it's just too obvious that the very variety a bung people is so great that even if you could find statistically, you know, averages that you hold up when you do the math, it wouldn't tell you anything about an individual. There's there's too much individual variation, So the old, uh, supremacists just sort of don't exist. If they do, they're just toothless. People haven't seen the dues of 20 years. All right, I should not make fun of the toothless. Um, so trump tweeted today. Um I have to read. The tweet, he said, has bubble. All us apologized. All those great NASCAR drivers and officials who came to his aid stood by aside and were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another hopes. That and flag decision has caused lowest ratings ever. Now the first question is what was the flag decision he's talking about? Because people are interpreting it to be the decision to get rid of the Confederate flag on race cars. But there is also a decision to allow people to deal for the national anthems. We don't know which one he's talking about. We'll see if he clarifies that if he's talking about the Confederate flag, that he's obviously decided not to be president. But we'll see if he clarifies that if he's talking about the regular flag, then that's just him talking the way he talks. But the second question is S e. Bubba to apologize for swiftly. We know wasn't his fault because we know he never saw it. He was told by somebody you trusted the president of Desperate, right? I told them what happened. He believes a very credible source, and then he acted upon it. And then when he found that it wasn't Riel, he said, he released a statement that I praised as being really well written, which said, Well, I'd rather look silly that to have this be riel Thanks for all the sport isn't a great wall. For all the support, one of the best recovery response statements by celebrity I've ever seen, it really was one of the bottle responses to somebody who best up Was it really assault? So he acknowledges he looks silly, says, Well, glad it wasn't the bad thing. Thanks everybody for having the right intentions and supporting me. I don't think it could have been better, really. So the president reading the rube raw or is he reading the room correctly makes a statement in which he basically Rubley accuses a black man in public. Now, if you could ever read the room more wrong than that, I would say that accusing a black man of a crime he did not commit because, like you said, he was just acting on information that came from somebody else, and the way he acted was completely appropriate with the information he had as it came to. So there wasn't anything he did that he needs to apologize for, in my opinion. So falsely blaming a black man in public today? I don't know if your instincts could be much worse than that. Uh, now I can see why it riles up the base. You'd like to think it's not because of racism, but rather, you know, he just represents somebody on the other side. But I know this is looked like such an old goal that, uh, you gotta turn the this one turns the the slaughter meter back. I think that turns it back to zero. Of course, the Conde thing is the only thing that matters. So it doesn't matter what Trump does at this point, and it doesn't matter what Biden does. Probably it probably doesn't matter. It probably only matters what Condi does from this point on. Does Cartier gets to pick the president, um, Formula One drivers who are different from NASCAR if you don't follow the sport. Formula One dryer drivers in a separate story, uh, some of them are standing, and some of them been dealing, I guess where there was a race yesterday or something, and a few of them don't want to wear black lives. Better shirts, But they instead wore a black shirt. This has end racism that they didn't want to deal at the bus about during the national it'll, but they were willing toe stand there with their shirts. So now we're getting some nuance from people. I don't think that's going to go well, eventually those people have to fight, I guess. Uh, so the two biggest news stories in the country, I think you'd agree. Or the Corona virus and race relations. What do you agree? I mean, the economy is always a story, but that's sort of a permanent always story. But in terms of really the most current of events, it would be Corona virus and race relations. Your new sources do not report useful data on either of those stories. The two biggest stories and your new sources don't even try to report useful data. Let me tell you what would be useful data, the death, gout every day from the crew numbers. Instead, they show us the infections. That was very obvious that if they show you the infections instead of the death count. And you can't deny that it's intentional at this point, both of the left and right, either That will show you the useful data. Okay, Sorry, I have to go blow my nose pretty soon. Let me see if I could add this quickly from the Corona virus. If they don't show you the death count, they're just giving you propaganda and manipulation because that's an important number. You need to know it and they're not telling you. It's very obvious. It's intentional. Secondly, for race relations, if they really wanted to give us data instead of just were Aisling us up, they would show us all the death counts over time and compared to things they would show you have. Any cops are killing black people, white people, different different colors and which showed over time they would show by city baby state, Maybe show you buy whether it's a Democrat mayor or a Republican mayor. That would be useful, right, because you want to know if a Democrat or a Republican approach makes a difference. You would also need to see the number of people were just murdered. How many black people kill black people list this week in overtime. Have any white people kill black people? Every black people kill white people. If you're not seeing that, you're just seeing propaganda. What do you say? It's just propaganda. If you don't see the basic death counts and you're being just found this story. All right. Um, I need to go. Oh. Then I guess, uh, over on Fox News, they're turning it against Trump as well. So there's a opinion piece written by Edmond De Marchand. Never seen him before. But you said Fox News. At least a penny piece of their website. And he said that this is his interpretation of Trump. So in a Fox news site, dissipated exist. Trump has praised the quote. Beautiful heritage of the Confederacy. Did that happen? Did you ever see Trump praise the quote? Beautiful heritage of the Confederacy? No, No, that never happened. He praised our beautiful heritage and the Confederacy and all manner of bad things. And all manner of good things are part of our heritage. But no, he never praised the beautiful heritage of the Confederacy. And this is on Fox News, which means they've turned against at least to some point And then it also calls out that he called the protesters quote thugs. Now that's called out to call him a racist by implication. And that's how the Fox News So even Fox News is running an anti trouble Peace. All right, that's all I got for now. I gotta go take care of some stuff and I will talk to you later.
