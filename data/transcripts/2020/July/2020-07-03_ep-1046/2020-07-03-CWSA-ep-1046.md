I'm It s a part of my microphone. And I will get out my notes, and I will be ready to present to you. Coffee was got Adams and the thoughts of the day, the news and the beginning of the best day you've had since yesterday. Yeah. Today is gonna be a It's gonna be a doozy. It really is. And before we get started, you know you need you need a cupper mugger. A glass of tanker tells her side of the canteen. Jug of Alaska Festival of any kind. Fill it with your favorite looking. I like coffee. What to hell. Just imagine this is by coffee that I didn't forget my coffee cup downstairs. You're gonna have to use your imagination. Okay, But it's the dopamine hit of the day. It's the best part of the day. It's the simultaneous hip works with any beverage. It happens now. Go. That might be the first time I've for gotten have my coffee cup with me. Well, that's just because there's somebody things happening. How many of you had elk as the statue that would be destroyed next? And the statue Deadpool? Did anybody guess elk? Because somebody said a statue of an elk on fire. It was obviously a way supremacist, elk. So, in a way, it had it coming, as things were. You know, as things continue into more and more ridiculous territory, I think we can see that maybe things were not what you thought they were. So you know what I mean? All right. I've decided that if you were to write this summary of the year 2020 you could do it with one sentence. Here it goes. The one sentence is summarizes 2020. We measured. We measured everything the wrong way. Is it my imagination or are something like 90% of the problems we've had in 2020 all around the same problem that we don't have to compare things. We don't have no added measure things we don't have the right data. We don't have a study things. It feels like a lot of this is self imposed. Meaning that Ah, a lot of the things that are making us that unhappy our just cause we don't know how to do math and compare things and and measure things. So look for that. Uh, one of my favorite things to do is watch CNN for what I call contempt to face those of you Listening will miss the magic of this next segment. But if you noticed there's a face they make on, see it end that you don't see on Fox News. Let me do an impression of somebody on Fox News. Both opinion and news people reading the news, blah blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Here's the news, all right. Did you see that? Nothing weird going on with my face. Now watch every CNN host or opinion person talking about President Trump with contempt Face. And it goes like this. And really, it doesn't matter the topics. I'll make up a topic. Let's say President Trump said that, um, racism is bad, right? You figure Well, most people would agree with that, even see with CNN. But no, they can turn anything into a negative with contempt. Face watch. Watch me do it now. Oh, and the president, he is claiming that the racism is bad. I clearly he doesn't mean it and you see what I mean. Contempt face. Now you can turn no story at all into a CNN feature just with contempt face. You just have to add the contemptible face like, Oh, I have so confused and and I hate it. And what's going on here? I see it from another world I dive just don't know. I can't even form a sentence. My contempt face has taken over my brain well enough of that. People have questioned me lately because I've said two things is sound contradictory and they do sound a contradictory. So I'm gonna clarify. I've said that in the corporate setting, the strategies are bullhead and they are in the corporate world, the person at the beating who says, What's our strategy? It is usually just the dumbest person in the meeting, and companies have largely given up on the whole strategy thing because there's just a lot of things you need to do, right? That's it. Is it a strategy for Amazon to be in the package shipping business? Or, I mean, you have delivering products. Well, it turns out they're just describing what you do doesn't really turn it into a strategy, Nor does it account if you have a strategy in the corporate world, nor does it account for changes and opportunity so your strategy might be, we're gonna make the highest quality product, and that's your strategy. How long does that last? It lasts until somebody else makes a better high quality product and you can't compete. Then what do you do? You say, Well, you know what we have going for us. Well, we can make a cheap product, and we could make a lot of them. So people will change their strategy in the corporate world to whatever is the best opportunity at the time. So strategy doesn't make much sense. Float in your personal life. That's where strategy matters, that the things that you specifically are doing, you could have a strategy. So the strategy would be, for example, go to college. Strategy would be stay in the jail strategy would be be nice to people and hope that they return the favor. The strategy might be to have systems instead of goals. Strategy might be to build your talent stack. A strategy might be contacting people to network on a regular basis. So in your personal life, whether you call it a strategy or a system or whatever word you want, it's really good to have in the corporate world. It just devolves into jargon, and it changes on a whim. But will it ever be a bad idea to improve your talent? Stack? No, it will never be a bad idea. Will there ever be a bad idea to increase your network? Nope. No, there's nothing that could happen that we don't make that a bad idea. But in the business world, there's so much happening that can change what your priorities are that, as strategy just makes less sense. And in a practical world, if you're in a practical sense of people of five people in a room they won't agree with, the strategy is anyway. So in the corporate world they can't agree with. The strategy is. But if it's you personally, you just pick one and go. You know nobody's going to argue with you about your strategy. So it turns out that Joe Biden is getting a very wide lead with the people over 65. I was looking at some anecdotal stuff. It's hard to tell anything from anecdotal, but they seem to blame the president for the krona virus. I saw CNN interview one elderly gentleman, a retired banker who said the the only the only good thing Trump stunned for the economy is juice, the stock market and even that's low now. And I thought to myself, Um, I don't think he's looked at the stock market lately because it's looking kind of strong at the moment. So old people do not make decisions based on data. Nobody else does, either. But the old people might be a little extra. You're not connected, depending on how old there. Uh, so here's the thing that is not factored into any of the polls At the moment, the only thing that moves old people is fear. If they're not afraid, then they get to make their decisions based on their complete lack of information, which is normal. If they're afraid, then they will do whatever they can to limit their fear. Now the thing that senior citizens are most afraid of is losing what they have. Yeah, they're a little less concerned with getting new stuff, you know, the at least the ones who vote than they are about losing what they have. So that's the fear that senior citizens have, which is I can't I can't go back to work. Whatever I have is gonna have to be good enough. I can't give any of that away so you could scare senior citizens into thinking they will lose their stuff. What would it take to scare senior citizens back to trump? Just lots of information about the protesters. Just lots of information about what the left actually looks like and what they want to dio. It's plenty scary. You don't have to add anything. Eso we'll see. We'll see if that happens. So remember, I beat the suggestion that, uh, for the sports that don't have live audience and we'll see a bunch of them while there's a Corona virus. I said they should have some kind of technology where people could hear the people watching a home cheering. It turns out that exists. It turns out that there's a nap, or I think it's a website app, basically called hero dot live and hero is spelled the way you here H e a r with a no in the end dot live. Apparently they're already doing business for ESPN and something else So is very reason that the n B A, for example, couldn't just say, Hey, everybody watching this game. If you use this app, you could all be sort of talking to each other by your phone so you would hear the cheering, but it would come out of your phone or your mobile device not out of your television. But it would be a real time because you would be connected to the people who are watching the same event at the same time. So that exists. It's called here. Oh, not live H e a r O that life. And I know that because the company contacted me to tell me I don't have any connection to them. All right, Um, here's my suggestion for improving the economy and making us robot proof. Are you ready? Goes like this. Here's something you don't know, So I'll give you some information and then complete this story. Many of you know I bought an electric Elektronik bike, meaning as a battery in it, and it assists. You're peddling, so you still have to pedal. You can't drive it without pedalling, but the bike just makes you feel like you have a superpower. Now, when I try to explain to people what that feels like because the way things feel really determined how things go right. It's not. Our common sense is not our data. It's the way things feel. And I gotta tell you, the way in E bike feels compared to a regular bike is day and night. You can't even compare them the feeling of being on a regular bicycle. Hold that in your mind. Almost all of you have been on a regular bicycle. It's pretty good, isn't it? Don't you kind of like riding a bike? I mean, if there no hills, you just It's a nice day and you're on a bike. It's a really good feeling. Now, I'm gonna give you an analogy to make you understand how much better it feels to be on an e bike because if you don't get how much better it feels, the rest of the idea will will not hold together. So I s I got to transmit to you the feeling goes like this. Imagine if everything in the world was exactly the way it is. The only changes that you personally have an 80% reduction in gravity, just you. Everything else in the world is the same gravity. But for magic reasons, you personally don't have the same amount of gravity, so you can jump 20 feet in the air. And when you come down, you don't even get hurt, because the only way 20% as much as you would have and your muscles are all the same. So it's easy now. Imagine a world in which you can run around and interact with the world. Everybody else's on regular gravity, but you're at 20% gravity. You can jump from things you could jump up on a ledge if you saw if you saw something, you know, way above you, you could just jump up like a cat jumps up on a counter you could run with, you know, like 20 foot leaps. Imagine what that would feel like if you didn't have gravity just on you. In a world where everybody else says gravity, it would feel amazing. That's what any bike feels like. I've never had a physical activity, this addicting, the feeling you have of being extra strong on your bicycle because the battery is sort of just helping you out there. That feeling is really addictive, and it doesn't feel like a regular bike with a little extra. It's a whole new experience. So just in the same way that, um, you know, if your let's say you're a distance runner and you really like it, it feels good. You get the you get all that, Um, and then I told you you could run 50% faster tomorrow it would be really a kick, wouldn't it? Imagine just being a little run 50% faster. So that's what any bike feels like. You can't compare. It is really addicting. Now here's the idea. The cost of the Buck E bikes will continue to plunge because the big costs is in the battery and battery costs are are dropping fast. Actually, I don't even know if the big causes the battery, but the cost will drop as the popularity increases. If you try to buy any bike, it's already hard to find. Most bike shops have them, but most of them are sold out. And I told I'm told some of you this story about when I test drove it at the bike place that the guy said, All right, you just take it out in the parking lot. It was a really big parking lot you just drive around, see what you think. I got a new bike and I took it 50 feet, and then I turned around and drove back 50 feet, all right. I just sort of drove to the end. Straight ahead drove back and he said, What do you think? And ice? And I said to him, The bicycle salesman, Has anybody ever written any bike and then not bought it? And he laughed. He said, There's something called the E Bike Smile. The after somebody does a test run, they come back and they can't get the smile off their face because they're they're experiencing almost a drug rush. It's so cool and they said, Yeah, they basically, if you can afford it and you do a test ride, you live with the bike That's it, he said. Basically, you just leave with the bike. I left with the bike 50 feet, sold me on that front freaking thing. So here's the thing. Still way too expensive for normal use, but prices will come down fast. Here's what we should do. We should build a national bike path, the guests to all the good stuff in America, Of course, seasons matters. You couldn't use it all year everywhere, but imagine if you will a major effort to build really good bike paths that are a combination of there might be. You need a bridge, a tunnel. You need to connect some things. They're already a lot of bypass, but you want to get them off of the road because the roads just a terrible place for a bike. It's just no fun. So even as good as the bike is, if I'm in heavy traffic, even in a bike lane, it's not much fun. You need sort of your own bike situation now. Why is this such a good idea? Because it's the type of job that you could learn to do, which is building a bike path and all the things associated with that, that you would suck up a lot of labor. It would be universal because there's no place you wouldn't want to do it. The government could say, I will pay for it. We'll train you, get people working on. Then here's the killer part. How are you going to build a country that's safe from the age of robots when everybody loses their jobs? And the answer is, I think we have to become a tourist destination country. The best one. The United States, with a bike path across the entire country, would first of all make it possible for anybody to have a vacation because you could just get on your bike, say all right or rent a bike. Probably as much rental is it. Would ownership. You see it is rent a bike. Going going 100 miles on any bike is actually trivial. You can go 100 miles on the bike and you just enjoy the right you're not. You wouldn't even necessarily be tired at the other end. Depending on the hills, you do have to peddle a little bit on the hills, but it's easy. So if these are the types of jobs that if you built a network of bike bags, you would need lots of support all along the network, you would need lots of bike repair places, kind of a job that people can get into young. You would need lots of food and water, and other resource is for bikes all the way, and you would build basically a reiss, a destination. Anybody from another country could come over to any part of the country and then use their E bikes to get to a huge circle of places without transportation problems. Hey, people say it's a good idea. That's the first time that I've seen so many people like my wild ideas. All right, enough on that. So think about that for a little bit. So here's a little update for you. Um, I've told you sometimes I planned things years in advance. So sometimes I'll set up a situation that can't pay off for five or 10 years. Very typical in my life. I've done that. And one of the times I did that was with this book, which many of you know, had it failed almost everything and still win big. When I wrote this book, which was full of, uh, full of useful framing, shall we say about how have systems and set of goals and have a stack your talents and basically had to organize your life a life strategy, if you will, a whole bunch of things that if you said all right, I'll take these parts and build myself a system that you would come out ahead and the thing that I planned in advance on this one is that there would be something like a five year lag between the time that the first people read it, because usually a lot of people read it when it's new. But not a lot of people read a book after it's been out for a while. All right, so you get mostly readers up front. And I knew that when people read this that I would get NA Number one best seller because I'm a cartoonist giving people a book, this outside my realm and generally that's a hard sell. And so when I wrote this, I said to myself, Alright, it's 2013 when this is going to come out and somewhere around 5 to 7 years from now I mean, I didn't know what exact time the people who read the book first and then employed. The suggestions are going to start coming forward. In other words, people are going to say I use this book and look what happened in my life. I got this promotion lost £80. I did this and that all those things were coming through, so I just got this is a little inside baseball kind of a talk. If you're an author, usually get paid up front for a book. It's called the advance. And then let's say they give you a dollar per book or whatever you've agreed in your deal for each book that sold. You don't get any more money than that initial check unless you sell so many books at a dollar a book just for my math example that that all of that would have added up to the first amount you got. Once you've earned that by selling a lot of books, then you can get additional checks. Uh, I may notable enough. Author will use that work that I always get in advance. Not every author is gonna get in advance. Sometimes we'll get a little one. That's just a token for your brand new author. Don't expect the big advance, but if you're well known and you've published a lot of books that did well, you get in advance. What is unusual in my case is to sell more books than the advance coverage, and I just got a big old royalty check for this thing 2013 and it just blew through its advance. It's actually it actually doesn't stop selling because the people who who were ready early are now report again and recommending it. And almost every day you see somebody in my feet recommending it with the story of how Eltham. So if you haven't read this and I'll say this again, you know, every author writes a book because they want you to buy it and it's part of their job. So they would like to get money, right? So, you know, we're all adults, right? Authors write books to make money. We know that, right? We don't have to argue about that, but I don't do things for one reason anymore. Um, you know, my life is now rich enough in let's say all the ways that I just don't do things for one reason. So I wrote this to really meant it for my stepson, honestly, who tragically died of an overdose before he finished it. He had started the book, actually, but he hadn't finished it, and it was really for people who just didn't have Ah, let's say, a father figure role model. They just didn't have anything in their life. They would tell them how to organize a successful life strategically. So I thought, Well, this will be This will be like a virtual dad, you know, like the it could be virtual mom toe make it less excess. Somebody who just gives somebody that that guidance That is not common sense. So I hates Hey, advertising stuff is just the creepiest thing. But if I didn't know that this changes lives, I wouldn't do it. It really changes lives and farm. Or then really, even I hoped it would. Um so that's the good news. Uh, so here's a good Here's something interesting. I think there are three different studies that came out yesterday and today or last few days. I think there are three different ones showing hydroxide Cleric win works. Have you seen them? Yeah. Somebody's mentioning atomic habits. There are a lot of books that have explicitly mentioned my book that went on to become huge best sellers. Eso You'll see a lot of people and they say that They say, You know, I got some portion of my book or my ideas from from specifically this book, so it's actually influenced a lot of best sellers since then. Eso I, Drax a clerk. We in terms that it works. Now I'm still waiting for more evidence. But when the people, when it was tested in a rigorous the first rigorous study showed it work like pretty well, uh, now this was test The people were already in the hospital. Um my smartest Ah, uh, smartest thinker, I guess who I always ask for for advice on this that it looks like a good study. But the way they did it, there's a There's a methodology imperfection that you have to take seriously. So I will still say, Even though there are three studies that seem to show hydroxide, Clerk Queen clearly makes a difference in a good way without actually killing people, I will still say we're not quite there. No, quite there. If I had to put the odds on it, the odds on it now, I would raise it quite a bit. I'd say at this point it looks like 75% chance. It's a positive thing. Maybe not. Maybe not a game changer, but probably is 75% chance it's more good than bad. So that's my current update. So how good was the President's Day yesterday. Studies were kicked me out of saying hydroxy chlor equipment works. The news was reporting that he's pro mask now, so that solves one problem and and the economy was screaming again. The the economy again beat expectations. All right, let's let's review Let's review which pundits and experts were right and who is wrong. If you if you took my advice, let's say if the country had taken my advice, we would have closed the travel from China one week sooner than it happened. So I was maybe one of the first few people in public was that close, that close travel. If you listen to me, you would have known that masks were, of course, obviously effective and that the government was, of course, obviously lying to you about that from day one. I said that really loudly on from the beginning, so you would have been wearing your masks sooner. Uh, I said early on that we don't know if I JAXA Cleric Queen works, and we can't trust those studies. But the risk reward is probably good, meaning that given the low downside and the anecdotal but unproven potential upside it just made sense to be using it. Now that is proven correct. All right, Some So that I see somebody in common saying mess are not very effective, that really that question is settled. So if everyone down, then somebody will send me something saying there's some dispute about whether masks work. I don't entertain that anymore. I do not entertain even the argument. The masks don't work it, Zo Overwhelmingly. But it's overwhelmingly obvious. And you wouldn't even need data. The data supports it, but it's just overwhelmingly obvious. I'm gonna say, All right, So and I will add one other thing on there. I'm who told you that the recovery would be surprisingly good? Surprisingly good. May and President Trump right now both of us, loudly and often said you're going to be surprised how quickly the economy comes back. And I gave my reasons, which was that nothing was broken. So, you know, people were already trained, so it just be a little easier to ramp up. Then it would be if you had a massive destruction of sometimes so sure enough, Um, my estimate of how these how the economy would come back would exceed expectations of the experts, and it has. And I said that a lot of times I said it would would would blow past what the consensus assumption would be that were there other news from another area Iran had, Ah, a mysterious explosion. It's called a mysterious explosion at that one of the key buildings at a nuclear site in Iran, where I guess they make advanced centrifuges. This would not be the first time that an Iranian centrifuge facility have a quote. Mysterious problem. You remember the other one, which was There was a famous cyber attack that made their machines go crazy and ruin older centrifuges. Well, this time just something exploded. Now, what's one of the things that people weren't, uh, the United States about when the Corona virus hit? Here is what we were warned. Hey, watch out, United States. Given that you're all distracted by this grown A virus stuff, United States, it could be that other countries will start to get adventurous because they think I your attention is turned somewhere else. Totally a risk. We should take that seriously, but there's a flip side to the risk, isn't there? The flip side is that we can take risks internationally that we maybe couldn't have taken before because they're also distracted. So I'm not going to say that the United States was behind the the mysterious explosion. I'm not gonna say that Israel was behind it. I mean, you can make your own assumptions on that, but But here's what I will say to add to the story. If it was either the United States or Israel, the timing was kind of perfect. The timing was perfect because everyone's distracted by Corona virus. So in order for Iran to get any any kind of wind and of having their facility attacked, they would either have to mount a counterattack, which looks impossible at this point. Or they would have to get public opinion on their side and nobody frickin Caribs. We just don't care about Iran at the moment. I mean, the world just sort of doesn't care way, just have other things to worry about. So if you look at the situation in Iran is in, their budget is completely blown up. I think they that their taxable income, you know the income they get by taxes is just a fraction of what they're spending them. So they're they're on a fast track to complete destruction, so they've got runaway inflation there, but their government budget is toast. Their oil revenue is nothing. The sanctions air cutting off their there, other ways to make money. And they've got a big Corona virus problem and they're still trying to keep their proxies alive. And, you know, whatever they're trying to do in Syria is probably not working out. It's getting expensive. So Iran is really on the ropes right now. And, uh, if if Israel or the US are getting adventurous in terms of trying to push them over the edge, it is the perfect time. It's a perfect time to do it. Uh, I've often said that the most important things that government does are the things you never find out about. So, you know, it could be that were deeply involved in whatever this whatever this mysterious stuff is going on, but you're never gonna know, or maybe years from now you'll know, Um, here's a interesting factoid that will blow your mind. You ready? One of the reasons that you listen to this periscope the regulars anyway, is that you like to hear something that you hadn't heard before or have something framed away that just makes you go. Uh, and it's especially delicious if it's something that you are positive is true. You've always been positive. It's true. And then you find out it isn't. It's kind of fun, Isn't it? A minute. It's kind of fun to find out that something you thought was true. Your whole life just isn't true. All right, I got one for you. Now. You have to. You have to fact check me on this, but I'm gonna give you a claim. The sounded plausible domain. But I'd like you to check it out for me. Okay? So here's the claim that I believe every conservative believes about what's what needs to be fixed in the black community to get us a so close to racial parity as possible. Correct. Correct me if I'm wrong. Conservatives overwhelmingly believe that the family unit staying together in other words, not being divorced and having two parents to raise a kid, especially fathers, right, especially fathers, that that's critical and that there's a gigantic difference in the black community with 70% I think it's 70% of black babies are born, uh, to a single parent. Now, that's what you know, right? Your conservative. You believe that? Um, the black babies in 2020 70% of them are being born to a single parent. And you believe that the key to success for any baby like, really, really The most important thing is to have a solid family unit that can kind of guide your upbringing, right? Those are things you believe are true. Here's a little factoid from Darren Bell, who is a African American cartoonist who I've known I've known off and I've noticed work for years. But he got involved in one of the Twitter threads and he dropped this little red pill on May. So I'm gonna drop the red pill on you. The Darren Bell dropped on me. But you have to fact check this OK, it goes like this. It is true, the 70% of black babies and 2020 will be born to single parents. But remember what I told you at the very beginning of this broadcast? I said that the biggest problem of 2020 is that we're measuring the wrong things. Apparently a huge percentage of that, 70% who are single are just living together like they're married and the and the father is completely involved. And that if you were actually to look at father involvement in a two parent situation, it's pretty close. It's pretty close. So you're most major assumption that these fatherless black kids are disadvantaged by the fatherlessness. According to Darren Bell, this is what you need to check. It's just not true. They're technically not married, but they operate as a married unit, and so the father is completely involved. And in fact, if you dig down to feeding and bathing the child, the black fathers, married or not, are in some of those categories. Actually, Mawr involved on average. Then then white fathers that look at the comments watch the comments go by. I don't think so. Nope, they don't, uh, Ababa. Somebody's somebody's having cognitive dissonance. Somebody is excited by it. Having a guy in the house doesn't equate to a father. Remember the second part of the survey, and Darren Bell sent the information so I could look at it myself. The second part went down to the details. Do they feed and bathe the care that they watch the kid and the answer is yes. So whether that's a father, father or the new boyfriend, statistically that kid's still getting a father. Now check that for May. Look, how many of you are having real trouble with that? Yeah, a lot of you. A lot of you are not liking this at all because it just blew up your most basic assumption. Now is it true? I would like you to check that? Because if it turns out that Darren Bella is the one that's wrong, well, let's find that out. So let's put a put attacking that by tomorrow somebody will have tweeted at me or told me the truth. Yeah, I'm watching the comments. Complete disbelief. Hard to believe somebody says it does pass the sniffed Asperger s old. Ah, and you're seeing a few people saying, Oh, shoot. Could we be that wrong? And the answer is you could be you could be that role. Now, Um, before I talk about some potentially helpful things for the black community, I would like to update you on my free speech exercise. So, as you know, I've been seeing how close I can get to the line of cancellation, Not just for fun, but to see if I can get to a point of useful, productive communication on a really sensitive topic race in America in order to be useful. I told you in advance I'm gonna have to walk right up to the line of cancellation because if I don't get right up to the line, I'm not gonna be able to be honest. And if I can't be honest, well, I'm no use. It'll a good ignore my That's my dog who's sleep barking If you hear that right rubber in the background when she sleeps, she runs and barks in her sleep. Anyway, so as part of my experiment to expand my free speech that I can get to the point of being actually useful, Um, I tweeted this and by the way, I don't think I could have tweeted this one month ago. But today no blowback so far could come later. So this is the tweet that had no blowback. If you can imagine this, this is for May. This morning I said black lives. Matter is a violent racist organization that includes lots of people with good intentions who don't fully understand what they're signing on to support now, don't you think I would have got canceled for that about a month ago? But today I can say it. It's partly because the conversation is getting richer. It's partly because people are a little bit more desperate for something that sounds like is useful. You know something that's true. Let me say this is clearly as possible. And if if there any African American people watching this, there always are. It turns out I've got a fast growing, um, Part of my audience is African American men and women, more men and women because I get more men on here than women. But it's a fast growing portion of what they're watching. And here's why. The next thing I'm going to say, I think here's why that IHS it's just my hypothesis. I can't prove this. I think the reason I'm getting a fast growing increase in black audience for what I dio is that I'm not gonna be condescending. I'm not going to treat you like you can't handle the truth, right? I mean, who doesn't appreciate that? And black people say this directly. All the time you hear this all the time. I'd rather you just told me the truth, All right? Don't know. Pretend you're blowing smoke up my ass and then go be a racist privately. Just frickin tell me the truth because I can deal with the truth. I just can't deal with this This Bs stuff. I don't know what to do with that. Perfectly reasonable. So here's some truth. Black people. I'm sorry. Here's some truth. White people almost routinely lied to black people because they feel they have to. White people almost universally lie to black people about race because they feel they have to. So if you would like to have an actual conversation about race, you're gonna have to get to the point where you can convince them white people to stop lying to you. Because if you can't get him to stop lying to you intentionally, how the hell they're gonna make any any difference of anything. So while I believe that black lives matter is more of, ah, political, violent, racist organization, that doesn't change the fact that there are lots of things that need to be fixed whether you're black or anybody else. And here are Here's my current thinking on this. We're going to the white board. How would you know that? He says, No, I'm speculating. So I tell you when I think I know something and I tell you what I'm speculating. So that was speculation, which you're free to disagree with and or affect. Check. All right, here's how I Here's how I see the world. Uh so the Democrats support teachers unions, teachers unions are the reason that you don't have school choice. That's the reason you have bad teachers. Teachers unions are the entire problem. Because if you get a bad school, you've got a bad life. Where are the bad teachers there in the inner cities, disproportionately teaching black students. So basically, the teachers unions are the source of most racism, right? Institutional racism is primarily, you know, through the thing that I would agree that black people say, is that there's definitely a ripple all the way from slavery. There's definitely something about the system that tries to maintain itself, which is which makes it harder for people to have the mobility that they need. There was way more more mobility, I think when I was a kid when I was young. There was way more mobility for everybody. So I think there's There's much to be said about systemic racism. Everybody's got their own definition of it. But this is a good example in my, in my opinion, this would be systemic racism with the primarily primary system, the teachers unions. And you can't fix that as long as Democrats have control. Because the teachers unions favor the Democrats. Therefore, the Democrats give the teachers unions what they want. The Republicans would like to break this bottle by saying, How about instead of a bad school about you have a choice, a little competition in there? All right. But, you know, maybe some charter schools, if you can get him, but at least competition and eso that's the Republican way to fix it now. Which of those two groups didn't Democrats or Republicans are trying to fix systemic racism in the place that it matters the most? In other words, if you get this right and by the way you know the the black Americans watching this, you know, jump in and I guess on my eye that's bothered me jump in and agree with us. If you get a solid education, enlists a useful thing. You still have racism to deal with. But you're gonna slice right through it. It doesn't make it go away, but you can make it less important, and everybody's got their thing right. I'm short. I'm old, you know, your your your ugly, you've got a weight problem. Whatever this, everybody's got something. But if you got a strong training and background and education, you can probably slice through your problem to just different problems. All right, then there's the city's because you can't. It's hard to fix anything, including the schools, if you're living in a place that's so depressed economically. And of course, the mayor's tend to be democratic in the big urban areas, and nothing can give fixed in urban area if there's money involved, because the people who want to sell their services to the city can just bribe people easily. Now, this has nothing to do with race. There's no race in this conversation as long as you have this model for cities where the people running the city can take bribes by big contractors, etcetera to do things. How could anything ever get fixed. It doesn't even. There's no system here that can fix that. The system, as it exists, is one super racist to unfixable. It's completely unfixable because you're going to be living in the middle of just garbage if you don't have any way for the mayor to do a real job when they're being bribed to do whatever the contractors right, the only way I could think of to fix the problem of cities being poorly managed is by the what I've called government in a box. Now I think somebody needs to create the government in a box option so the voters can at least have an option. Imagine if you would. I don't know. Now, in California, you can put anything on a ballot you call the proposition. If you get enough signatures. I don't know how widespread that ISS. So somebody fact check me on this, but suppose that you had an urban area that was just a mess. Let's take Baltimore. So Baltimore is just a mess, right? And we know that, um, you know, the the governance is probably part of the problem. Historically supposed somebody started a petition and said, Look, if we get enough signatures here and enough votes, we will replace the mayor and the administration for, Let's say, one year could be three years. Where of this but limited time with this government in a box, which might be, Who knows? Maybe it's people from Switzerland who just want to come in and they don't care about your country. They're just trying to do their jobs so they get recommended to be government in a box in another city. So they want to do a good job. Just cause it's a business, right? A government doesn't need to do a good job if it can also get elected. If your mayor knows he or she is going to get reelected, they don't really have to do a good job. But if you had a government in a box, which was a private company, let's say consultants who would come in for a year or three, just straighten things out, get things on the right track, and then and then at the end of that, you say I it's time for these guys to move on, fix another city, Uh, but until that exists until until you have a government in the box option until somebody offers it. You're just stuck with the old system, which is racist in a systemic way. Now let me offer you my most provocative. I thought for ending racism. No would end. Racism will come close. So let's say ending racism is too big because we're, you know, humans or just we're unfixable when it comes to recognizing patterns, especially fake batters, so you can't get rid of people's bias. But you can certainly find systems that overcome them so so well that they don't matter as much. All right, here's the most provocative thing I will ever say. You really and I can only say this because you've those. If you have followed my lessons on persuasion and you know the facts don't matter, etcetera, you have to brainwash Children. Children need to be brainwashed. They need it because if you don't brainwash them, somebody else will. Either television will or their friends will or or they'll they'll just work it out on their own, Which is the worst case if you don't brainwash kids and I'm using that term very, um, thoughtfully. Children are not influenced their brainwashed, and you gotta do it right or you don't get a good kid, right? So how could black America brainwash its own kids easily, easily and fix an entire generation the moment they're born? All right, so here's an idea that won't fix. People have already been born and have already reached a certain age. I'm talking about something that would stop it cold from this point on so that the next baby born would be born into a better world. And here it goes. You convinced somehow, because this would require persuasion as well, so the black community would have to embrace this wildly for it to work. You embrace this. The education is the key to success, the education, including any kind of profession. So I'm talking about a skill stack. I'm talking about the kinds of things you would learn in this book, etcetera. And so this is all education, But I'll say a practical education. So imagine if you will. The black America says, Hey, let's let's end racism and everybody will say That's not possible. That's too hard. Oh, yeah. Watch this. Watch this. We're going to get every mother you don't even need. The father's to this and I'll tell you why you don't need the father's admit. But you don't need the father's to be part of this and just the moms keep it simple. The fathers can help, but they're not required. And the mother from the first time the baby can hear says You're going to college or education is the thing. Education is the thing. Education is the thing. And you just brainwash those kids into thinking education is the thing. Now I've gone further and said You could make a checklist and say, If you don't, if you check any of these boxes, you're not going to succeed one of them. Did you have trouble with the law? Did you get involved with drugs or gang? You know, So that is sort of an easy checklist, and you just give that checklist to every new mom in an urban area. And again this would work. This works for everybody. The fact that I'm talking about the black experience doesn't mean it's limited. This this would work for everybody. And you just say, Here's the checklist, kid. Oh, you're only two years old. You don't quite understand this. Well, look how important it ISS I know you don't understand it, and you're three years old. Still don't understand that. But you realize there's a checklist, these of things you need to do. Stay off drugs. Education is the key that the kids about five at around five they don't. They don't understand how the world works, but the brainwashing becomes permanent. Education is your way to success. Education as you wait a success, education and again practical education. I'm not talking about, you know, an English degree. It could be mechanics or programming or any practical thing. And what would happen 18 years from them or, let's say, 20 years from 21 years from them, 21 years from them. Let's say that every black mother just started drilling that into their kids doesn't mean they'll do it, but they're drilling it in, and you start developing a generation which 21 years from now you're an employer. All right, wait for this. Here's the good part. It's 21 years in the future and you're an employer. A black applicant comes in fresh out of college. What do you say to yourself because you're a racist? Because everybody's by us, right? It's just not something. You can turn it off. So what do you say to yourself? 21 years after that All started hypothetically, you say to yourself Oh, good. I got a super baby. I got a super baby. You're hired because all you want to hear if you're an employer is that you got a kid who came up through a system from the moment they were born. Educate, educate, educate, educate, educate, educate its your way out. You tell me that kid doesn't get the job. I know that kid gets the job. And what happens when that kid well educated does Well, Well, people started noticing it. You could in one generation, turn racism upside down. And you could say to yourself, Black black kid comes in for an interview. He's 21 he was born from the From the moment he was born, he was drilled with education. White kid comes in looks like sort of a similar background. But you don't know what kind of programming that kid had. Oh, no. I think you take the one that got brainwashed. The most productive way education. Now, why do I mention this? Because this is what my mother did to me. My mother was not educated, nor was my father. Both my mother and my father had to repeat a grade in school now, my mother, because she had some family problems. My father, because you just had a low I. Q. So he just failed a grade and the way that people do. So neither my parents had any college, but from the moment I could understand language, my mother said to me, You're going to college, Secure your success. You can do anything you want, you're going to college. It's a key to your success. You're going to college now. She didn't have any money and didn't even know anybody had been to college. But that simple little mantra if I could call it that program to me, it programs me do is not one moment of my life that I didn't think I was going to college and we couldn't even afford it. We couldn't even come close to affording it, especially with three kids. We figured it out. You know, I got some scholarships and, you know, my brother and sister went to less expensive colleges, etcetera. We figured it out but we never doubted that that was the path. Now that's my suggestion is something that 100% of people could dio. There's no mother who couldn't program there, kid. You just have to say it over and over and over again. It that's all it is. Kids can be programmed just by repetition, consistency and repetition. It's all it is. In one generation, you could turn a black applicant into a super baby. In other words, the employer says, Yeah, I want somebody who came up with that kind of programming, All right, Um, that probably was just about all they wanted toe. Oh, yeah, There's another interesting thing. Elon Musk is having a online debate with some other smart people and experts, and the line is pointing out that, uh, the Corona virus test kits can be as inaccurate as 50% false positive. It could be as high as 50% false positive, and he's saying that's the reason the number of infections seems to be going up. It's a combination of mawr testing, plus the fact that the testing is so inaccurate, plus the fact, as other people put piled in and said that the hospitals air now open for other business. Now, I have a surgery scheduled minor surgery scheduled. And I can tell you for sure that the process is I have to get a Corona virus test and that I have to self quarantine for two weeks before I before I go in for my surgery. Now, this is elective. But suppose you went in, you just went in and you didn't You didn't have a surgery plan, just went in to the emergency room. Well, the first thing they do is they test for Prodi virus. So if there are simply more people going to the hospital for unrelated reasons, you're gonna pick up a lot more Corona virus because some of them will have it. So, uh, so Ellen is arguing the point. Now, I'm not sure that I agree with Alan's point because these air complicated situations and there's probably a lot of stuff I don't know, but it would explain the unexplained, the most unexplained the thing in this phenomenon. Correct me if I'm wrong. The most unexplained thing is why infections air going up while death rates are going down. Oh, I know what you're going to say it's the time lag, but I don't think the time lag is going to change it. That's my prediction that there might be some change, but it's not gonna change the major trend. The major trend is that infections were going up and deaths were going down. I think that's going to continue, and I don't know how you would explain that other than your detecting more cases that are the mild kind, that would be part of the explanation. The other part could be they're doing better with badges. They're doing better with ventilators. Yeah, they're just getting smarter. In general, it's possible. Alright, That is what I wanted to cover today. So I believe I said, Let's see what if we fixed today? We fixed the long term economy to make us protected against robots by building in a national network of bicycle paths and turning us into a bicycle tourist destination with mostly e bikes. In the future, we have said we fixed racism by I told you a mantra. Three words know how many words are. Education is the key. Education is lucky. Write four words. Five words. Whatever you want, But something like that a little mantra for mothers would transform Children. Now, you still have to keep the matter jail and all that. So that's the problem. And, of course, if you voted Republicans and you could get maybe some school choice and that would fix your school situation. Yeah, I think we fix just about everything today. Is there anything I haven't fixed yet? I don't think so. I fixed your personal lives. So you will have better lives because of this. Yeah. I think almost everything is fixed. Do we have any other problems you like me to get to? Um, all right. Well, let's send does that because I think that's the good news. And things were looking up. Stock markets. Good. This country is going to be fine. And so will you. Talk to you later.
